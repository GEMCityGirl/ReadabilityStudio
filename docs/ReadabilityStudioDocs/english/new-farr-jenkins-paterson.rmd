The New Farr-Jenkins-Paterson readability formula calculates the grade level of a document based on sentence length and number of monosyllabic words.

New Farr-Jenkins-Paterson is Kincaid et al.'s recalculated version of the [FJP](#farr-jenkins-paterson) test [-@{kincaid-fishburne-rogers-chissom:1975}17] that was recalculated "to be more suitable for Navy use" [@{kincaid-fishburne-rogers-chissom:1975}11]; hence, it is designed for technical documents and manuals. In addition to being a recalculation, this variation of FJP (i.e., a Flesch-like test) returns a grade-level result, rather than an index score.

This test was trained against reading-test results from 531 U.S. Navy personnel from four Naval technical training schools. Using these results, the following multiple regression equation was derived:

```{definition, newfjp, name="New Farr-Jenkins-Paterson formula"}
$$
G = 22.05 + (.387*(W/S)) - (.307*((M/W)*100))
$$
```
