## Amstad\index{Amstad|ii} {#amstad}

The Amstad test is a recalculation of [Flesch Reading Ease](#flesch-test)\index{Flesch Reading Ease!variations!Amstad} for German text. Its formula is adjusted from the original Flesch to take into account German's comparatively longer words. It also uses a lower weighting for the sentence-length factor, placing most of the influence on word length.

The factors used for this test are syllables per word (“*Silben pro Wort*”) and words per sentence (“*Wörter pro Satz*”). (The same factors used for Flesch Reading Ease).

Amstad (78–81) is best suited for school textbooks and technical manuals. Scores range from 0–100 (the higher the score, the easier to read) and average documents should be within the range of 60-70.

```{definition, amstad, name="Amstad formula"}
$$I = 180 - (W/S) - (58.5*(B/W))$$
```

Where:

+:----+:----------------------------------+
| I   | Amstad (i.e., Flesch) index score |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| W   | Number of words                   |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| B   | Number of syllables               |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| S   | Number of sentences               |
+-----+-----------------------------------+

Amstad offered these interpretations for scoring:

```{r, echo=F}
kableExtra::kbl(read_delim("data/AmstadConversionTable.txt", "\t", escape_double=F, trim_ws=T),
                booktabs=T, centering=T, linesep="",

                align='rll', escape=F) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width=F)
```

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
Like Flesch Reading Ease, this test treats numerals\index{numerals!Amstad} as monosyllabic words by default. This behavior can be changed from the [**Options**](#readability-test-options) dialog.

## Lix {#lix-german}

Refer to \@ref(lix-test).

## Lix\index{Lix!variations!German children's literature} (German children's literature) {#lix-german-childrens-literature}

This test is a German variation of [Läsbarhetsindex (Lix)](#lix-test) designed for children's literature. It uses the same index-score formula as Lix, but uses different scales for assigning the difficulty and grade-level scores. This adjustment was developed by Renström (152–153) and Bamberger & Vanecek (64, 187) for use with German literature ranging from 1^st^ to 8^th^ grade. (Renström developed the adjusted difficulty gauge; Bamberger & Vanecek developed the grade-level conversion.)

Note that this test differs from the original Lix approach of using the same scoring for any document, regardless of language. Instead, this test is designed specifically for German materials, adjusting the grade-level score and classification of the index value.

Regarding the index score, the following variation of the Lix gauge is used classify the difficulty (Renström 153; Bamberger and Vanecek 65; Schulz 53):

```{r germanLix, echo=F, fig.cap="German Lix gauge (children's literature)", fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/GermanLixGauge.png")
```

This version adjusts the scaling of the score, assuming that German text is inherently more difficult than other languages. It also includes additional levels of difficulty (e.g., “children and young adult”).

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
To convert the Lix index score to a grade, this test uses the following table:

## Lix\index{Lix!variations!German technical literature} (German technical literature) {#lix-german-technical}

This test is a German variation of [Läsbarhetsindex (Lix)](#lix-test) designed for technical literature. It uses the same index-score formula as Lix, but uses different scales for assigning the difficulty and grade-level scores. This adjustment was developed by Renström (152–153) and Bamberger & Vanecek (64, 187) for use with German literature ranging from 3^rd^ to 15^th^ grade.

## Schwartz German Readability Graph {#schwartz}

The Schwartz German Readability Graph\index{Schwartz German Readability Graph|(ii} (1–21) is a derivative of [Fry’s](#fry-test) readability graph and is designed for instructional textbooks for primary and secondary students. Like Fry, it relies on sentence length and word complexity (i.e., syllable counts) to determine a document’s difficulty.

As an elementary teacher, Schwartz\index{Fry!derivatives!Schwartz} was familiar with English tests and had found them “extremely helpful in classifying texts according to levels and fitting a student with proper reading material” (3). Later, as a high school German teacher, she was often asked if there were any German readability tests.

After corresponding with Prof. George Klare and Dr. Richard Bamberger, she confirmed that only two German tests existed (as well as some unpublished cloze\index{cloze} procedure experiments). She then interviewed West German publishers to see how they classified school textbooks. They informed her that their process was to compare student dictionaries against their materials to gauge difficulty, as well as use large print and illustrations.

Schwartz then set out to create a German readability test, given the lack of such a tool at the time. She initially experimented with word frequencies as a factor, but decided that sentence length and word complexity were easier to calculate when computer assistance wasn’t available. She also determined that a graphical test—such as Fry—was easier to use by classroom teachers than regression formulas. Hence, Schwartz created a new graph similar to Fry, but adjusted it for the West German basal readers that she used in her study.

When designing the graph, Schwartz adjusted the syllable-count axis to take into account German words' tendency to have higher syllable counts. As she noted, “It is commonplace that the average German word contains more syllables than the average English one” (14). In her samples, she noted that English averaged 25 syllables per 100 words, while German averaged 37 (14).

Another difference from the Fry graph is that some grade bands cover two grades (whereas each band on a Fry graph represents a unique grade).

```{r echo=F, fig.show = 'hold', out.width='50%', fig.cap='Comparison of bands between Schwartz and Fry graphs, respectively'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Schwartz.png")
knitr::include_graphics("Images/frygraph.png")
```

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
As Schwartz noted:

> Furthermore, it might be of interest to the American reader to note that it used to be quite common in Germany to have certain reader levels combined in one volume: usually third and fourth, fifth and sixth, seventh and eighth, sometimes even fifth through eighth, and that often there was no distinction made inside the book itself as to in which grade a particular text had to be read. (5–6)
:::

In the study, between 15–21 random 100-word samples were taken from 2^nd^–8^th^ grade textbooks and between 11–15 100-word samples from 1^st^ grade textbooks. The following textbooks were used:

- *Lesebuch für die Volksschulen, Vierter Band. 7. und 8. Schuljahr*
- *Lesebuch. C 8 (8. Schuljahr)*
:::

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
Schwartz noted the following validation results:

- Grade 1: 83% of the 70 samples fell in the grade 1 band on the graph, 91% falling in either the grade 1 or 2 bands.
- Grade 2: 30.5% of the 105 samples fell in grade 2, although 82% fell in the 1, 2, or 3/4 bands.
- Grades 3 and 4: 29% of the 164 samples fell in the 3/4 band, although 77% fell within the 2, 3/4 , or 5/6 bands.
- Grades 5 and 6: 40% of the 72 samples fell in the 5/6 band, while 81% fell in the 3/4, 5/6, or 7/8 bands.
:::

Altogether, of the 411 samples for grade levels 1–6, 75% of them either fell into the proper band on the graph, or within one grade level.

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
When counting the sentences and syllables in a document, Schwartz had the following recommendations:

- Exclude headers (“headlines”)
- Treat numerals as one syllable
- Speech set off by a colon mid-sentence should be counted as a separate sentence
:::

```{r, results='asis', eval=T, echo=F}
OptionsDesc <- "Because of this, the program uses sentence units when counting sentences. Numerals are also counted as one syllable by the program, regardless of the project\'s settings."

OtherDesc <- "Because of this, sentence units should be used when counting sentences. Numerals should also be counted as one syllable."

glue('Regarding the last point, it could be inferred that independent clauses set off by colons, semicolons, and em dashes should also be counted as separate sentences. $if_else(UserManualMode, OptionsDesc, OtherDesc)^', .open='$', .close='^')
```

Plotting and interpreting the Schwartz graph is the same as other Fry-like graphs. Once you have found the average number of syllables and sentences per 100-words, plot the intersection of these two statistics on the graph. The band that the point falls in will represent the grade-level score of the sample.\index{Schwartz German Readability Graph|)}

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
An item of interest when interpreting this graph is the x axis. Although the labels read *25*, *26*, etc., they actually represent *125*, *126*, etc. The *100+* with the arrow underneath it (to the left) indicates that the axis labels should have 100 added to them. This is done to make the labels more compact.

Although this is an unusual display, this is how the graph is drawn in the original article. Therefore, to preserve fidelity with the source material, it is recommended to use this same style.

## Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek)\index{Wheeler-Smith!variations!Bamberger-Vanecek (German)} {#wheeler-smith-bamberger-vanecek}

Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek) (77, 186) is a German variation of [Wheeler-Smith](#wheeler-smith) designed for both primary and secondary-age reading material. It calculates the grade level of a document based on [unit](#glossary)\index{sentences!units} length and number of complex words.

```{definition, wheelersmithde, name="Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek) formula"}
$$
I = ((W/U)*((C/W)*100)) / 10
$$
```

Where:

```{r, echo=F}
wheelersmithBVData <- tibble(col1 = c("I", "C", "W", "U"),
                             col2 = markdown_to_kable_cell(c("Index value",
                                      "Number of 3+ syllable^a^ words",
                                      "Number of words",
                                      "Number of units")))

colnames(wheelersmithBVData) <- rep('', ncol(wheelersmithBVData))
kableExtra::kbl(wheelersmithBVData, booktabs=T, centering=T, align='l', escape=F) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_classic(full_width=F) %>%
  footnote(alphabet = c(markdown_to_kable_footnote('“*drei- und mehrsilbigen*”')),
           escape=F, threeparttable=T)
```

Then, find the index value in the following chart to acquire the final readability score:

```{r, echo=F}
kableExtra::kbl(read_delim("data/WheelerSmithBV.txt", "\t", escape_double=F, trim_ws=T),
                booktabs=T, centering=T, linesep="",
                caption="Wheeler-Smith (Bamberger-Vanecek) Conversion Table",
                align='lr', escape=F)
```

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
Although Bamberger and Vanecek (77, 186) do not specify using units\index{sentences!units} instead of sentences, the use of units is assumed to match Wheeler-Smith.

Based on the examples from Bamberger and Vanecek (77, 186), index values should be truncated to one-point precision, not rounded.
