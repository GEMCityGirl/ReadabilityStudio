## Crawford\index{Crawford|(ii} {#crawford}

The Crawford (1–17) test is designed for “elementary level materials in Spanish” (4). This test calculates the grade level of a document based on sentence length and syllable count.

The test was derived from a multiple regression equation trained against 10 basal readers series collected from the United States, Latin America, and Spain. (These series represented grade levels 1–6 and contained 789 100-word passages in total.) Across these reader series, Crawford noted somewhat significant correlations for syllables per 100 word (an average of $r = 0.4152$) and a consistently stronger correlation for sentences per 100 words (an average of $r = 0.6395$). Using these findings, the following equation was built:

```{definition, crawford, name="Crawford formula"}
$$
G = (S*-.205) + (B*.049) - 3.407
$$
```

Where:

+:----+:----------------------------------+
| G   | Grade level                       |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| S   | Number of sentences per 100 words |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| B   | Number of syllables per 100 words |
+-----+-----------------------------------+

A chart visualizing this test's score is also available:

```{r crawfordgraph, echo=F, fig.cap='Crawford chart', fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/CrawfordGraph.png")
```

In this chart, the Y axis and interior (i.e., plot area) represent the factors, and the X axis represents the final score. Specifically, the Y axis represents the sample's syllable count, and the interior area represents the sample's sentence count. After finding the intersection of these two factors, the position on the X axis respective to this intersection yields the grade-level score.

Note that this differs from other graphs which use the X and Y axes to represent the factors and their intersection to represent the score. Instead, this chart displays the sentence-count values as a series of steps across the plot area.

For example, in the above graph the number of syllables is 175. The number of sentences is approximately 7 (between 8.4 and 5.9 [on the plot, respective to 175 on the Y axis]). After finding the intersection of these factors, the point's X axis value is 3.7. Hence, 3.7 is the sample's grade-level score.

This test is designed for 100-word samples and uses the same statistics as the [Fry](#fry-test)\index{Fry} test. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)\index{Crawford|)}

## FRASE\index{FRASE|(ii} Graph {#frase}

FRASE (Fry Readability Adaptation for Spanish Evaluation)\index{Fry!derivatives!FRASE} (Vari-Cartier 141–148) is a graphical test for Spanish text. This test calculates a document's language level from its average number of sentences and syllables per hundred words. These averages are plotted onto a chart where their intersection determines the reading level of the content.

The test uses methodologies borrowed from the [Fry](#fry-test) graph, such as using the same factors (sentence length and syllable count). However, it also includes adjustments which differentiate it. One adjustment is that is X axis begins at 182 (Fry begins at 108)—this is used to account for Spanish text having higher syllable counts compared to English. The second adjustment is that it uses reading levels (“Beginning,” “Intermediate,” “Advanced Intermediate,” and “Advanced”), rather than grade levels. By using reading levels, documents can be classified more broadly into reading groups, which makes this test ideal for SSL (Spanish as a second language) readers.

The FRASE graph is designed for most text and can be used for both primary and secondary-age reading materials, as well as SSL materials. It was trained on eight textbooks representing the four levels of difficulty:

- *Nueva Vista*
- *Español: A Descubrirlo*
- *Entre Nosotros*
- *Vista Hispánica*
- *Civilización y Cultura*
- *Multivista Cultura*
- *Español: Curso Primero*
- *Perspectivas*

These textbooks “covered a variety of reading topics which dealt with family life, entertainment, customs, the hispanic people, history, and politics” (Vari-Cartier 143). 300-350 word excerpts were randomly selected from each book, scored on a FRASE graph, and then objectively and subjectively validated.

These validation involved correlating the FRASE scores against “teacher judgments, Spaulding formula ratings, cloze\index{cloze} test scores, and informal multiple choice tests” (144). (The “teacher judgments” validation involved 16 secondary-level Spanish teachers ranking the samples into the levels of beginner, intermediate, advanced intermediate, and advanced.) The comparisons were significantly correlated, with the following results:

- cloze tests: $r = -0.93$
- Spaulding scores: $r = 0.91$
- teacher judgments: $r = 0.95$
- multiple choice tests: $r = -0.97$

Below is an example of a FRASE graph:

```{r frase, echo=F, fig.cap='FRASE graph', fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/FraseGraph.png")
```

The FRASE graph procedure is:

- Extract a 100-word passage from the selection. If the material is long, take subsamples from the beginning, middle, and end.
- Count the number of sentences in each passage. Count a half sentence as .5.
- Count the number of syllables in each passage.
- Find the intersecting point on the plot. The quadrant where the point lies indicates the reading level of the document.

This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)\index{FRASE|)}

## Gilliam-Peña-Mountain\index{Gilliam-Peña-Mountain|(ii} Graph {#gilliam-pena-mountain-fry-graph}

Gilliam-Peña-Mountain\index{Fry!variations!Gilliam-Peña-Mountain} (426–430) is a graphical test for Spanish text based on the [Fry](#fry-test)\index{Fry} graph (“Clarifications, Validity, and Extension” 242–252). It is identical to the Fry graph, except that its X (syllable-count) axis begins at 175 (instead of 108). This is necessary to account for Spanish text having a much higher syllable count than its English counterpart. As the authors stated, “Spanish syllable counts, however, were so high that they threw many of the samples outside the bands or off the graph entirely” (427).

This test calculates the grade level from the average number of sentences and syllables per hundred words. These averages are plotted onto a chart where their intersection determines the reading level of the content.

This variation of Fry was trained on samples from the following textbooks:

- *¡Vas bien!*
- *¿Ya te vas?*
- *¡Hasta luego!*
- *Nuestros amigos*
- *Senda 1*
- *Trabaja y aprende*
- *La ciudad*
- *Del campo al pueblo*
- *Aventuras maravillosas*
- *Otros amigos, otras culturas*
- *Senda 3*
- *Conozcamos a Puerto Rico*
- *Por tierras vecinas*

It was also trained on the following juvenile trade books:

- *Aquí viene el ponchado*
- *Osito*
- *El caso del forastero hambriento*
- *Leonardo el león y Ramon el ratón*
- *Jorge el curioso*
- *Teresita y las orugas*
- *Danielito y los dinosauros*
- *Johnny Lost (Juanito Perdito)*
- *El niño que no creía en la primavera*

Syllable and sentence statistics where calculated from these samples. Initially, the researchers noted that most of these statistics could not be plotted onto a Fry graph, because of the high syllable count. They deduced that a constant would need to be subtracted from this syllable count to be able to plot it on the graphs. Next, they determined where on the graph these materials should lie based on the either the grade level provided by the publisher or by plotting an English translation of the material onto a graph. By comparing the differences between the actual and expected syllable counts, it was determined that subtracting 67 from the Spanish syllable counts would adjust the score to appear on the graph where it was expected to be.

The Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph is designed for both primary and secondary-age reading materials. Below is an example of a Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph:

```{r gpm, echo=F, fig.cap='Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph', fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/GpmFry.png")
```

The Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph formula is:

- Extract a 100-word passage from the selection. If the material is long, take subsamples from the beginning, middle, and end.
- Count the number of sentences in each passage. Count a half sentence as .5.
- Find the point on the chart.
```{r, results='asis', eval=T, echo=F}
OptionsDesc <- " However, note that *Readability Studio* shifts the syllable-count axis by 67, rather than adjusting the actual syllable count. This approach preserves the syllable count, while still being able to plot the score on the graph."
AltDesc <- " An preferred alternative method is to shift the syllable-count axis by 67, rather than adjusting the actual syllable count. This approach preserves the syllable count, while still being able to plot the score on the graph."

glue('- Count the number of syllables in each passage and subtract 67 to adjust for the higher syllabic nature of Spanish text.$if_else(UserManualMode, OptionsDesc, AltDesc)^', .open='$', .close='^')
```
- If the sample's syllable or sentence count is too low or high for it to be plotted, then adjust that factor so that it can fit onto the chart. For example, if a sample has 261 syllables per 100 words, then this will need to be adjusted to 249.
- Repeat this process for each sample, and then average the samples.

This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)

Note that numerals\index{numerals!Gilliam-Peña-Mountain} are fully syllabized for this test. For example, “1945” will be counted as nine syllables (“u-no”-“nu-e-ve”-“cua-tro”-“cin-co”).\index{Gilliam-Peña-Mountain|)}

## SOL\index{SOL|(ii} {#sol-spanish}

The SOL readability formula (Contreras 21–29) calculates the grade level of a document based on complex-word density.

SOL is a modified version of [SMOG](#smog-test)\index{SMOG!variations!SOL (Spanish)} (McLaughlin 639–646) that was recalibrated for Spanish text. This test calculates the SMOG score of a Spanish document, and then adjusts the score to take into account the comparably higher complex-word counts found in Spanish text. This adjustment is similar to what [Gilliam-Peña-Mountain](#gilliam-pena-mountain-fry-graph)\index{Gilliam-Peña-Mountain!compared to SOL} (426–430) uses for plotting Spanish text onto the [Fry graph](#fry-test)\index{Fry}.

This test was trained on multiple blocks of 30-sentence samples from the following English, Spanish, and French materials:

- *The Lancet* (Spanish and English)
- *El Pais* (Spanish)
- *Le Monde* (French)
- *International Herald Tribune* (English)
- *The Quixote* (Spanish, English, and French)
- *The Bible* (Spanish, English, and French)
- *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs* (Spanish, English, and French)
- *The Three Bears* (Spanish, English, and French)
- *The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids* (Spanish, English, and French)
- *The Three Little Pigs* (Spanish, English, and French)
- Story books (a set of story books) (Spanish, English, and French)

SMOG scores for these samples (including available translations) were collected. Next, the scores between each language for every set of material were then correlated. The researchers found significantly higher SMOG scores for French compared to English, and higher SMOG scores for Spanish compared to French. To adjust for these differences, the following regression equation was built to convert a Spanish SMOG calculation to English ($r^2 = 0.60$):

```{definition, sol, name="SOL formula"}
$$
G = (1.0430*\sqrt{C} + 3.1291)*.74 - 2.51
$$
```

Where:

+:----+:----------------------------------------+
| G   | Grade level                             |
+-----+-----------------------------------------+
| C   | Number of complex words (3+ syllables)\ |
|     | from 30 sentences                       |
+-----+-----------------------------------------+

```{r, results='asis', eval=T, echo=F}
OptionsDesc <- ", so the program overrides your [numeral syllabication](#document-analysis) setting for this test"

glue('Like SMOG, this test fully syllabizes numerals\\index{numerals!SOL} (i.e., sounds them out)$if_else(UserManualMode, OptionsDesc, "")^. It also excludes lists and tables, but includes headers and footers (Contreras et al. 23). (SMOG does not explicitly follow this rule.)', .open='$', .close='^')
```

Note that this test uses the high-precision version of the SMOG formula. This is recommended by the authors to avoid any rounding issues when converting scores between Spanish and English (Contreras et al. 24).

This test requires 3 10-sentence samples, but [normalization](#glossary) can be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.\index{SOL|)}
