## Column Sorting {#column-sorting}

::: {.wrapfigure data-latex="{r}{0.5\\textwidth}" style="width: 48%;"}
![](Images/columnheader.png){width=48%}
:::

You can sort any list column by clicking on the column header.

The first time you click a column's header, that column will be sorted into ascending order. This means that the column's values will go from smallest to largest as you move downward. For numeric columns, numbers will be sorted 1, 2, 3, etc. as you go downward. For text columns, the column will be sorted alphabetically, going from A-Z as you move downward.

Clicking the column a second time will sort that column into descending order. As we can see below, the **Syllable Count** column is sorted in descending order (largest to smallest):

To toggle the sorting order, click the column header again.

::: {.wrapfigure data-latex="{r}{0.5\\textwidth}" style="width: 48%;"}
![](Images/sortcolumnsdialog.png){width=48%}
:::

To sort a list by multiple columns, click the `r keys("Sort")` button in the **Edit** section on the **Home** tab of the ribbon and the **Sort Columns** dialog will appear.

On this dialog, you will specify which columns to sort by and their order. Going from top to bottom in this grid, the columns specified here will act as the sorting criteria for the list. The list will be sorted by the first specified column (and its respective sorting order), and in the case of a tie between two or more rows, the next specified column will become the sort criterion between those rows, and so on. To add a column as a sort criterion, double click a row in this grid and select the column name from the drop-down box. Once you have selected the columns to sort by, click the `r keys("OK")` button to sort the list.

## Graphs

::: {.minipage data-latex="{\textwidth}"}
When any graph is selected:

![](Images/SentenceBoxPlotSelected.png)
:::

Options for customizing it are made available on the **Edit** section of the ribbon:

![](Images/RibbonEditGraphs.png)

The options made available will be dependent on the graph type. Refer to \@ref(options-graphs) for further discussions of these options.

Refer to \@ref(customizing-a-graph) and \@ref(custom-brush-example) for step-by-step tutorials on editing a graph.

## Customizing How Documents are Analyzed

After creating or opening a project, you can customize how the program analyzes the source document(s). For example, you can change how numerals\index{numerals} are syllabized or how sentence endings are detected. To edit these options, click on the **Document** tab of the ribbon:

![](Images/RibbonEditDocumentOptions.png)

::: {.tipsection data-latex=""}
With a standard project, you can review these changes in realtime by selecting any highlighted text report in the [**Words Breakdown**](#reviewing-word-breakdowns) or [**Grammar**](#reviewing-standard-grammar) sections. As you make changes, the program will reanalyze your document and these changes will be visible in this window. For example, changing how words are being excluded or how sentence endings are deduced will become apparent as you make changes from the ribbon.
