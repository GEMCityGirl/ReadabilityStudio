# `StandardProject`

Provides the functionality of a standard project.
Standard projects analyze a single document and provides numerous results related to readability and other style metrics.

Note that changing various features of a project once it has been loaded will cause it to re-analyze its document.
As an optimization, this analysis can be delayed until all these features have been changed.
This is done by:

- calling [`DelayReloading()`](#standard-delayreloading)
- calling any functions that require a re-analysis
- and finally calling [`Reload()`](#standard-reload)

For\index{examples!creating a standard project} example\index{projects!creating from a document}:

``` {.lua}
-- Open a document from user's "Documents" folder.
consentForm = StandardProject(Application.GetUserPath(UserPath.Documents) ..
                              "Consent Form.docx")

-- Delay reloading while we change a few options.
consentForm:DelayReloading(true)
consentForm:AggressivelyExclude(true)
consentForm:ExcludeTrailingCitations(true)
-- Reindex the document so that the changes take effect.
consentForm:Reload()

-- Assuming we have a custom test by this name, add it.
consentForm:AddTest("Patient Consent Formula")
-- Select list of unfamiliar words for the custom test.
consentForm:SelectWindow(
    SideBarSection.WordsBreakdown,
    Application.GetTestId("Patient Consent Formula"))
