# `StandardProject`

Provides the functionality of a standard project. Standard projects analyze a single document and provides numerous results related to readability and other style metrics.

Note that changing various features of a project once
it has been loaded will cause it to re-analyze its
document. As an optimization, this analysis can be
delayed until all these features have been changed.
This is done by:

- calling **[DelayReloading()](#standard-delayreloading)**
- calling any functions that require a re-analysis
- and finally calling **[Reload()](#standard-reload)**

For example:

``` {.lua}
-- Opens a document from user's "Documents" folder
-- and changes a few options.
consentForm = StandardProject(Application.GetDocumentsPath() ..
                              "Consent Form.docx")

-- Delay reloading.
consentForm:DelayReloading(true)
-- Change a few options.
consentForm:AggressivelyExclude(true)
consentForm:ExcludeTrailingCitations(true)
-- Reindex the document so that the changes take effect.
consentForm:Reload()

-- assuming we have a custom test by this name.
consentForm:AddTest("Patient Consent Formula")
```
