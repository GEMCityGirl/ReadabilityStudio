# Resources

## Art Assets

All original assets are stored in **Resources/Art Assets**. New or edited materials should be saved into the appropriate folder in **Resources/ReadabilityStudio** in PNG format (except the `splash` folder, these are JPEGs)

Images in the **Resources/ReadabilityStudio/ribbon** and **Resources/ReadabilityStudio/tests** folders should be ~256x256 pixels in size (or smaller). After saving, run the script **Resources/Scale Icons.lua** to rescale and center any images if necessary.
