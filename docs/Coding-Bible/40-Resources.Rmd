# Resources

## Art Assets

All art assets are stored in **Resources/Images**. Images should be saved into the appropriate folder in SVG format (except the `splash` folder, these are JPEGs). SVGs should have an aspect ratio with the same width and height.

## Word Lists

### Editing Lists {-}

In the **Resources/Words** folder, the following folders contain word lists used by the program. Some can be edited, others are generated. Also, all these files are meant for all languages, unless otherwise noted.

Please refer to the following file & folder breakdown for reference:

- **base-personal.txt**: person names should go in there.
- **abbreviations**:
  - **abbreviations.txt**: list of abbreviations that the program uses to determine abbreviations. (Words in here must include their periods.)
  - **non-abbreviations.txt**: list of words that should never been seen as abbreviations. This will be long words that contain no vowels, but are still an actual word.
