> \=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=
>
> This package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and
> decompression.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
> method for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing
> "real-world" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images
> are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
> exactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you
> have to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,
> very good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and
> remarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a
> low-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment
> with various compression settings.
>
> This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
> compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
> processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
> For legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding
> variants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting
> the hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.
> We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
> plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
> perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
> The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
>
> In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
> considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
> for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
> decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
> colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
> library if not required for a particular application.  We have also included
> "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG
> processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple applications for
> inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
>
> The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
> flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
> the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
> REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
> be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
> achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
> We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
> No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
> documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

> The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.

> Preamble
>
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
> freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General
> Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
> and change free software--to make sure the software is free for
> all its users.
>
> This license, the Library General Public License, applies to
> some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and
> to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can
> use it for your libraries, too.
>
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure
> that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software
> (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive
> source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
> the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
> you know you can do these things.
>
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
> anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
> rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
> for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you
> modify it.
>
> For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights
> that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or
> can get the source code.  If you link a program with the
> library, you must provide complete object files to the
> recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after
> making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you must
> show them these terms so they know their rights.
>
> Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1)
> copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which
> gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the
> library.
>
> Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this
> free library.  If the library is modified by someone else and
> passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is
> not the original version, so that any problems introduced by
> others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
> patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies
> distributing free software will individually obtain patent
> licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into
> proprietary software.  To prevent this, we have made it clear
> that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not
> licensed at all.
>
> Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
> ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for
> utility programs.  This license, the GNU Library General Public
> License, applies to certain designated libraries.  This license
> is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in
> full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the
> ordinary license.
>
> The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries
> is that they blur the distinction we usually make between
> modifying or adding to a program and simply using it.  Linking a
> program with a library, without changing the library, is in some
> sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a
> utility program or application program.  However, in a textual
> and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
> derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General
> Public License treats it as such.
>
> Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
> Public License for libraries did not effectively promote
> software sharing, because most developers did not use the
> libraries.  We concluded that weaker conditions might promote
> sharing better.
>
> However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive
> the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status
> of the libraries themselves.  This Library General Public
> License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to
> use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of
> such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated
> in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards
> changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
> changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is
> that this will lead to faster development of free libraries.
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference
> between a "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the
> library".  The former contains code derived from the library,
> while the latter only works together with the library.
> Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the
> ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one.
>
> GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
> contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
> authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
> this Library General Public License (also called "this
> License").  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
>
> A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
> prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application
> programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form
> executables.
>
> The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or
> work which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work
> based on the Library" means either the Library or any derivative
> work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
> Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
> modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
> language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
> limitation in the term "modification".)
>
> "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source
> code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus
> any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used
> to control compilation and installation of the library.
>
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
> not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The
> act of running a program using the Library is not restricted,
> and output from such a program is covered only if its contents
> constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use
> of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true
> depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
> the Library does.
>
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
> complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
> that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
> appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep
> intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the
> absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License
> along with the Library.
>
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a
> copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in
> exchange for a fee.
>
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any
> portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and
> copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms
> of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these
> conditions:
>
>  a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
>  b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
>  stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
>  c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
>  charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
>  d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
>  table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
>  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
>  is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
>  in the event an application does not supply such function or
>  table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
>  its purpose remains meaningful.
>  (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
>  a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
>  application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
>  application-supplied function or table used by this function must
>  be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
>  root function must still compute square roots.)
>
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
> Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
> separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,
> do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
> separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as
> part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the
> distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License,
> whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
> it.
>
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
> contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
> intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
> derivative or collective works based on the Library.
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
> Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library)
> on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring
> the other work under the scope of this License.
>
> 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General
> Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the
> Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
> to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General
> Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.  (If a
> newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public
> License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead
> if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these notices.
> Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
> that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to
> all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
> This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
> the Library into a program that is not a library.
>
> 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
> derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable
> form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you
> accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
> source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
> interchange.
>
> If distribution of object code is made by offering access to
> copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to
> copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
> requirement to distribute the source code, even though third
> parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
> object code.
>
> 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
> Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being
> compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
> Library".  Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work
> of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
> License.
>
> However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
> creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library
> (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
> "work that uses the library".  The executable is therefore
> covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution
> of such executables.
>
> When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header
> file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work
> may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source
> code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if
> the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is
> itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not
> precisely defined by law.
>
> If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
> structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small
> inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of
> the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is
> legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this object
> code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section
> 6.)
>
> Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
> distribute the object code for the work under the terms of
> Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under
> Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
> Library itself.
>
> 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile
> or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to
> produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
> distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
> the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own
> use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.
> You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that
> the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
> covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this
> License.  If the work during execution displays copyright
> notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library
> among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the
> copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of these things:
>
>  a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
>  machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
>  changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>  Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
>  with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
>  uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
>  user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
>  executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
>  that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>  Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>  to use the modified definitions.)
>
>  b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>  least three years, to give the same user the materials
>  specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>  than the cost of performing this distribution.
>
>  c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
>  from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
>  specified materials from the same place.
>
>  d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
>  materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
>
> For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
> Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
> reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything
> that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
> with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
> operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
> component itself accompanies the executable.
>
> It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
> restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
> accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you
> cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable
> that you distribute.
>
> 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
> Library side-by-side in a single library together with other
> library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute
> such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution
> of the work based on the Library and of the other library
> facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
> these two things:
>
>  a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
>  based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
>  facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
>  Sections above.
>
>  b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
>  that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
>  where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
>
> 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
> distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this
> License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
> link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License.
> However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
> under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
> long as such parties remain in full compliance.
>
> 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have
> not signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to
> modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These
> actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this
> License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library
> (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance
> of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for
> copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on
> it.
>
> 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on
> the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license
> from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or
> modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions.  You
> may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
> exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
>
> 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of
> patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to
> patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
> order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of
> this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
> License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
> simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
> pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license
> would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
> all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
> then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License
> would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
> under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
> intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to
> apply in other circumstances.
>
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe
> any patents or other property right claims or to contest
> validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose

>
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is

>
> 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted
