The author would like to thank the helpful library staff of [Edison State Community College](https://www.edisonohio.edu/) and [Wright State University](https://www.wright.edu/). Their assistance with tracking down hard-to-find articles—and helping me with the microfilm machine—is greatly appreciated.

The author would also like to thank all the users of *Readability Studio* over the last `r (lubridate::year((lubridate::now())) - 2006)` years.
