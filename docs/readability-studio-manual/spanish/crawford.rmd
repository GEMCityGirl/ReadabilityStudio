## Crawford\index{Crawford|(ii} {#crawford}

The Crawford test is designed for "elementary level materials in Spanish" [-@{crawford}4]. This test calculates the grade level of a document based on sentence length and syllable count.

The test was derived from a multiple regression equation trained against 10 basal readers series collected from the United States, Latin America, and Spain. (These series represented grade levels 1â€“6 and contained 789 100-word passages in total.) Across these reader series, Crawford noted somewhat significant correlations for syllables per 100 word (an average of $r = 0.4152$) and a consistently stronger correlation for sentences per 100 words (an average of $r = 0.6395$). Using these findings, the following equation was built:

```{definition, crawford, name="Crawford formula"}
$$
G = (S*-.205) + (B*.049) - 3.407
$$
```

Where:

+:----+:----------------------------------+
| G   | Grade level                       |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| S   | Number of sentences per 100 words |
+-----+-----------------------------------+
| B   | Number of syllables per 100 words |
+-----+-----------------------------------+

A chart visualizing this test's score is also available:

```{r crawfordgraph, echo=F, fig.cap='Crawford chart', fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/CrawfordGraph.png")
```

In this chart, the Y axis and interior (i.e., plot area) represent the factors, and the X axis represents the final score. Specifically, the Y axis represents the sample's syllable count, and the interior area represents the sample's sentence count. After finding the intersection of these two factors, the position on the X axis respective to this intersection yields the grade-level score.

Note that this differs from other graphs which use the X and Y axes to represent the factors and their intersection to represent the score. Instead, this chart displays the sentence-count values as a series of steps across the plot area.

For example, in the above graph the number of syllables is 175. The number of sentences is approximately 7 (between 8.4 and 5.9 [on the plot, respective to 175 on the Y axis]). After finding the intersection of these factors, the point's X axis value is 3.7. Hence, 3.7 is the sample's grade-level score.

This test is designed for 100-word samples and uses the same statistics as the [Fry](#fry-test)\index{Fry} test. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)\index{Crawford|)}
