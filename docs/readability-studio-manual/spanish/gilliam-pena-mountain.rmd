## Gilliam-Peña-Mountain\index{Gilliam-Peña-Mountain|(ii} Graph {#gilliam-pena-mountain-fry-graph}

Gilliam-Peña-Mountain\index{Fry!variations!Gilliam-Peña-Mountain} [-@{gilliam-pena-mountain}426–30] is a graphical test for Spanish text based on the [Fry](#fry-test)\index{Fry} graph [-@{fry:extensions:1977}242–52]. It is identical to the Fry graph, except that its X (syllable-count) axis begins at 175 (instead of 108). This is necessary to account for Spanish text having a much higher syllable count than its English counterpart. As the authors stated, “Spanish syllable counts, however, were so high that they threw many of the samples outside the bands or off the graph entirely” [-@{gilliam-pena-mountain}427].

This test calculates the grade level from the average number of sentences and syllables per hundred words. These averages are plotted onto a chart where their intersection determines the reading level of the content.

This variation of Fry was trained on samples from the following textbooks:

- *¡Vas bien!*
- *¿Ya te vas?*
- *¡Hasta luego!*
- *Nuestros amigos*
- *Senda 1*
- *Trabaja y aprende*
- *La ciudad*
- *Del campo al pueblo*
- *Aventuras maravillosas*
- *Otros amigos, otras culturas*
- *Senda 3*
- *Conozcamos a Puerto Rico*
- *Por tierras vecinas*

It was also trained on the following juvenile trade books:

- *Aquí viene el ponchado*
- *Osito*
- *El caso del forastero hambriento*
- *Leonardo el león y Ramon el ratón*
- *Jorge el curioso*
- *Teresita y las orugas*
- *Danielito y los dinosauros*
- *Johnny Lost (Juanito Perdito)*
- *El niño que no creía en la primavera*

Syllable and sentence statistics where calculated from these samples. Initially, the researchers noted that most of these statistics could not be plotted onto a Fry graph, because of the high syllable count. They deduced that a constant would need to be subtracted from this syllable count to be able to plot it on the graphs. Next, they determined where on the graph these materials should lie based on the either the grade level provided by the publisher or by plotting an English translation of the material onto a graph. By comparing the differences between the actual and expected syllable counts, it was determined that subtracting 67 from the Spanish syllable counts would adjust the score to appear on the graph where it was expected to be.

The Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph is designed for both primary and secondary-age reading materials. Below is an example of a Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph:

```{r gpm, echo=F, fig.cap='Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph', fig.align='center', out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/gpm-fry.png")
```

The Gilliam-Peña-Mountain graph formula is:

- Extract a 100-word passage from the selection. If the material is long, take subsamples from the beginning, middle, and end.
- Count the number of sentences in each passage. Count a half sentence as .5.
- Find the point on the chart.
```{r, results='asis', eval=T, echo=F}
OptionsDesc <- " However, note that *Readability Studio* shifts the syllable-count axis by 67, rather than adjusting the actual syllable count. This approach preserves the syllable count, while still being able to plot the score on the graph."
AltDesc <- " An preferred alternative method is to shift the syllable-count axis by 67, rather than adjusting the actual syllable count. This approach preserves the syllable count, while still being able to plot the score on the graph."

glue('- Count the number of syllables in each passage and subtract 67 to adjust for the higher syllabic nature of Spanish text.$if_else(UserManualMode, OptionsDesc, AltDesc)^', .open='$', .close='^')
```
- If the sample's syllable or sentence count is too low or high for it to be plotted, then adjust that factor so that it can fit onto the chart. For example, if a sample has 261 syllables per 100 words, then this will need to be adjusted to 249.
- Repeat this process for each sample, and then average the samples.

This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results. ([Normalization](#glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)

Note that numerals\index{numerals!Gilliam-Peña-Mountain} are fully syllabized for this test. For example, “1945” will be counted as nine syllables (“u-no”-“nu-e-ve”-“cua-tro”-“cin-co”).\index{Gilliam-Peña-Mountain|)}
