## Gunning Fog\index{Gunning Fog|(idxit} {#sec-gunning-fog-test}

The Gunning Fog readability formula [-@{gunning}39–41] calculates the grade level of a document based on its number of sentences and complex words.

Complex words are words that contain three or more syllables, with the exception of:

- Proper nouns.\index{proper nouns!Gunning Fog}
- Words made three syllables by adding *ed* or *es* (e.g., *created* or *trespasses*).
- Compound words composed of simpler words.
[*Readability Studio* considers hyphenated words to be compound words (e.g., *horse-power* or *and/or*).]{.content-hidden when-profile="reference"}
(Note that forward slashes (*/*) are treated like hyphens in this context.)

This test can optionally count independent clauses as separate sentences, as *The Technique of Clear Writing* instructs. It should be noted, however, that this can cause misleadingly low scores for documents that contain run-on sentences. Consider the follow:

::: {.fancyquotes data-latex=''}
The Meldorf^®^ statistical library is available in C++ source code–a low-level programming language–and in the form of a COM library–a Microsoft^®^ technology for inter-program communication; the COM library can be called from numerous languages, such as: Visual Basic, C#, and Delphi.
:::

If you treat independent clauses as separate sentences, then this will be seen as six small sentences and produce a Fog score of 10.2.
If you count sentences by only looking for *.*, *?*, or *!*, then this will be counted as a single 44-word sentence and produce a Fog score of 19.
To penalize run-on sentences (which is recommended), then leave the option [**Count independent clauses as separate sentences**](#sec-readability-test-options) unchecked for this test.
