The Spache Revised test [-@{spache:1974}195â€“207] calculates the grade level of a document based on sentence length and number of unique unfamiliar words. This test uses a list of 1,041 common words that are known to younger readers (4^th^ grade and below). Any word that does not appear on this list is considered unfamiliar. The following are also considered familiar:

- Regular verb forms of any common word (i.e., *ing*, *es*, *s*, *ed*, and *ies* endings). Irregular forms are not familiar.
- Regular plural and possessive forms of any common word (i.e., *s*, *es*, and *ies* endings). Irregular forms are not familiar.
- Adjectival or adverbial forms of common words. This includes forms with endings such as *ly*, *est*, *er*, and *ily*.
- Derivatives of common words where the function changes (e.g., an adjective changed to function as a noun) are not familiar unless explicitly on the common word list. For example, *brave* is a common word, but *bravery* would not be considered familiar.
- Hyphenated words if both parts of the word are common words. For example, *apple-tree* and *and/or* would be familiar. Note that forward slashes (*/*) are treated like hyphens in this context.
- All proper nouns.\index{proper nouns!Spache Revised}
- All numerals\index{numerals!Spache Revised}.

Spache Revised is generally used for primary age (i.e., Kindergarten to 7^th^ grade) readers to help classify school textbooks and literature. This differs from [New Dale-Chall](#sec-dale-chall-test)\index{New Dale-Chall!compared to Spache Revised}, which is better meant for secondary age readers.

Because this formula uses familiar words (rather than syllable or letter counts), it is often regarded as a more accurate test for younger readers.

Spache Revised formula:

$$
G = (.121 * (W/S)) + (.082 * UUS) + .659
$$

Where:

+-----+--------------------------------------------------+
| G   | Grade level                                      |
+-----+--------------------------------------------------+
| S   | Number of sentences                              |
+-----+--------------------------------------------------+
| W   | Number of words                                  |
+-----+--------------------------------------------------+
| UUS | Number of unique unfamiliar words per 100 words\ |
|     | (see note below)                                 |
+-----+--------------------------------------------------+

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
Spache recommends not counting the same unfamiliar word more than once if it appears in subsequent 100-word samples [-@{spache:1974}200]. For this reason, it is recommended to follow this practice when analyzing an entire document.
