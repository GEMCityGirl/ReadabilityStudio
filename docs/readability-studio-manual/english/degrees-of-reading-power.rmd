## Degrees of Reading Power\index{Degrees of Reading Power|(ii} {#sec-degrees-of-reading-power}

The Degrees of Reading Power [@{kibby}416–27; @{carver:1985}303-16] formula calculates the difficulty level of a document in terms of DRP units. These units range from 0 (easy) to 100 difficult).

The DRP difficulty score of document is used to match it to a student based on their DRP ability score. DRP ability tests are manual tests administered to students to gauge their reading levels.

This test is based on the [Bormuth Cloze](#sec-bormuth-cloze-mean-machine-passage) test and uses the same criteria for its calculation. Basically, this test uses the Bormuth formula to calculate a [predicted cloze score](#sec-cloze), converts it to percentage format, and then inverts it to arrive at the units score.

```{definition, drp, name="Degrees of Reading Power formula"}
\begin{align*}
  U = & 100 - 100*(.886593 - .083640*(R/W) + \\
      & .161911*(D/W)^3 - .021401*(W/S) + \\
      & .000577*(W/S)^2 - .000005*(W/S)^3)
\end{align*}
```
