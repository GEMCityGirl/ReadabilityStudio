## Modified SMOG\index{Modified SMOG|(idxit} {#sec-modified-smog}

The Modified SMOG\index{SMOG!variations!Modified SMOG} test [@{lsmith}129–32] calculates the grade level of a document based on sentence length and number of difficult (i.e., 3 or more syllable) words and is designed for primary and secondary-age materials.

Modified SMOG differs from [SMOG](#sec-smog-test) in the following ways:

- It uses the unique number of difficult words (rather than the total).
- It uses a smaller constant in its formula.
- The score is rounded, rather than floored.

Because of these adjustments, it will generally produce scores closer to other tests than SMOG does—in particular, the Fry graph [@{lsmith}129].

The author's decision to not count repeated difficult words was a major factor in making this test more appropriate for primary readers.
As he explains, in a particular pre-primer book "the word 'kangaroo' appeared 52 times . . . it was the only polysyllabic word in the book. To count the word more than once would have inflated the readability score to an unrealistic level" [@{lsmith}130].

The steps for calculating Modified SMOG are:

- Take 3 10-sentence samples.
- Count the number of unique words containing 3 or more syllables.
- Calculate the square root of this count and round it.
- If this square root is 4 or more, then add 1. Otherwise, the square root should remain the same. This will be the grade level score.

Note that numerals\index{numerals!Modified SMOG} are fully syllabized (i.e., sounded out) for this test[, so the program overrides your [numeral syllabication](#sec-numsyllable) setting when calculating it.]{.content-hidden when-profile="reference"}[.]{.content-visible when-profile="reference"}

This test requires a 10-sentence sample, with 3 samples being recommended for best results. ([Normalization](#sec-glossary) can also be used to analyze larger samples or entire documents.)\index{Modified SMOG|)}
