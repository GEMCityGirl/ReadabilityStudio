## Easy Listening Formula\index{Easy Listening Formula|(idxit} {#sec-easy-listening-formula}

The Easy Listening Formula is designed for "listenability" and is meant for radio and television broadcasts. Fang [-@{fang}65] stated that broadcasted news generally has much shorter sentences compared to print media. Therefore, he created the ELF test to focus solely on complex-word density, not using sentence length as a factor. That is, rather than looking at a sentence’s word count, the density of syllables in a sentence is used instead.

This test was trained on 36 television scripts from the following:

- ABC
- CBS
- NBC
- Local newscasts from the Los Angeles network stations KABC-TV, KNXT, and KNBC

To compare listenability to readability, the study was also trained on 36 newspaper samples from the following:

- *The New York Times*
- *The Wall Street Journal*
- *The Christian Science Monitor*
- *The Los Angeles Times*
- *The Chicago Tribune*
- *The St. Louis Post-Dispatch*

The newscasts yielded the following ELF ranges:

- ABC: 9.9–12.0
- CBS: 9.6–11.9
- NBC: 8.7–10.7
- KNXT: 11.5–13.1
- KNBC: 10.2–12.3
- KABC-TV: 6.4–9.0

While the newspaper samples yielded the following:

- *The New York Times*: 16.8–18.2
- *The Wall Street Journal*: 13.8–15.1
- *The Christian Science Monitor*: 10.3–13.1
- *The Los Angeles Times*: 14.7–18.0
- *The Chicago Tribune*: 14.2–18.6
- *The St. Louis Post-Dispatch*: 11.3–17.1

Note the stark difference between the printed and televised-material scores. This indicates a much higher complex-word density in printed news versus televised news.

To further validate the test, Fang compared [Flesch Reading Ease](#sec-flesch-test) scores against ELF and found a strong correlation of $r = 0.96$.

The ELF score of a sentence is calculated by counting the number of syllables above one for each word. For example:

::: {.fancyquotes data-latex=''}
In any sentence, count each syllable above one per word.
:::

The above sentence contains three polysyllabic\index{polysyllabic} words: any (2), sentence (2), above (2), and syllable (3). In this case, *any*, *sentence*, and *above* each have 1 syllable above 1, and *syllable* has 2 syllables above one. Adding these values will yield a score of 5.

This process is repeated for every sentence, and then these scores are averaged. A simpler method is shown below:

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
