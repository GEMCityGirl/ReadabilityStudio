# Overview

Readability Studio provides access to its functionality through a Lua API (Application Programmer Interface).
By using this API, Lua scripts can be written and executed from within *Readability Studio* to automate various tasks.

The primary interfaces to this API are:

- **[Application](#application)**
  Provides access to the current application, its full set of features, and its active projects
- **[StandardProject](#standardproject)**
  Standard project objects, which can analyze a document and export its results
- **[BatchProject](#batchproject)**
  Batch project objects, which can analyze multiple documents and export their results
