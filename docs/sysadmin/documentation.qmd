## Style Guide {-}

The following styles should be applied to all help projects:

- Software and library names should be italicized
- References to dialog/menu/button/tab names should in bold
- File names should be double quoted
- Folders and file paths should be put in `file_path` blocks
- Data types (programming docs) should be in typewriter font
- Parameters to functions (programming docs) should be italicized
- Values (numbers and strings) in programming docs should be in typewriter font
- Values elsewhere:
  - Numbers should not be formatted
  - Strings and single characters should be italicized (quoting them makes them difficult to read)

## Editing {-}

The documentation is stored in *Quarto* projects in the `r file_path("readability-studio-manual")`, `r file_path("readability-studio-api")`, and `r file_path("sysadmin")` folders.

To change any of these projects' settings or add topics to them, edit these files:

- `r file_path("readability-studio-manual")`:
  - "\_quarto.yml.in": the base settings
  - "\_quarto-manual.yml": the settings specific to the {{< latex >}} manual
  - "\_quarto-online.yml": the settings specific to the HTML help
  - "\_quarto-sysadmin.yml": the `r file_path("sysadmin")` project file
- `r file_path("sysadmin")`: see the "\_quarto-sysadmin.yml" file in `r file_path("readability-studio-manual")`
- `r file_path("readability-studio-api")`: "\_quarto.yml"

::: {.warningsection data-latex=""}
Do not edit `r file_path(c("docs", "readability-studio-manual", "_quarto.yml"))`, as it is generated by the help build script.
Edit `r file_path(c("docs", "readability-studio-manual", "_quarto.yml.in"))` instead if needing to make changes.
:::

::: {.warningsection data-latex=""}
Do not edit any topics in `r file_path(c("readability-studio-api", "enums"))`.
These files are generated by the help build script.
:::

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
The project folders `r file_path("readability-test-reference")`, `r file_path("release-notes")`, and `r file_path("shortcuts-cheatsheet")` are built from content in the `r file_path("readability-studio-manual")` folder.
They are dynamically built by the build script and should not be edited.

## Screenshots {-#creating-screenshots}

### Generating Screenshots {-}

All screenshots are generated from a script; they should never be created manually.

To generate screenshots, run the script `r file_path(c("docs", "generate-screenshots.lua"))` from *{{< var PROGRAM_NAME >}}*.
This will generate all new screenshots in the folder `r file_path(c("docs", "readability-studio-manual", "images"))`.

The subdirectory `r file_path("non-generated")` will not be effected, but does not need to be.
The `r file_path("non-generated")` folder should not contain images effected by the program's UI changes.
It also should not contain images with content that should be localized.

### Reviewing Screenshots {-}

After generating new screenshots, [build](#building-help) the help and review the following topics to verify that the values referenced in the screenshots match the help:

- "reviewing-readability-graphs.html"
- "reviewing-statistics.html"
- "reviewing-batch-scores.html"
- "reviewing-batch-box-plots.html"
- "reviewing-batch-histograms.html"
- "searching-for-overly-long-sentences.html"
- "reviewing-dolch.html"
- "analyzing-a-work-in-progress.html"
- "reviewing-a-collection-of-documents.html"
- "excluding-text-from-analysis.html"
- "creating-a-custom-index-test.html"
- "finding-difficult-sections.html"

## Building {-#building-help}

Run `r file_path(c("docs", "build-help-projects.R"))` to build all help projects.
This should install all needed {{< fa brands r-project title="R" >}} and {{< latex >}} packages the first time you run it.
If there are any errors while installing the {{< latex >}} packages, run the script again; you may experience connection issues to *ctan* and re-running the script will fix it.
