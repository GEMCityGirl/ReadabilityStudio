## Installing {-}

Make "Readability_Studio-{{< var UNIX_ARCHITECTURE >}}.AppImage" executable.
This can be done with the following syntax:

```{.bash}
chmod u+x <AppImage File>
```

This can also be down by right-clicking the file, selecting `r menu(c('Properties', 'Permissions'))` and checking *Allow executing file as program*.

This only needs to be done once.
Now "Readability_Studio-{{< var UNIX_ARCHITECTURE >}}.AppImage" can be ran directly to launch the program.

## Updating {-}

Replace your existing AppImage with the latest version.
Make the new AppImage executable and then it will be ready to run.
