| Requirements |
| :-- |
| 64-bit Windows {{< var WIN32_REQUIRED >}} (or higher) |
| x86_64 processor |
| {{< var MIN_RAM >}} of RAM ({{< var RAM_RECOMMENDED >}} recommended) |

The *Microsoft Visual C++ runtime* is also required.
This is normally managed via *Windows Update*, but can also be installed manually.
To install, download and run the latest [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist) installer.

## Installing {-}

Run the installer ("rssetup{{< var FULL_VERSION >}}.exe") as an administrator.
You will be prompted for a user name, where to install the program, and which components to install.
After answering these prompts, continue the installer to completion.

## Updating {-}

To upgrade an installation, run the installer ("rssetup{{< var FULL_VERSION >}}.exe") as an administrator and follow the prompts.
If there is a previous installation of *{{< var PROGRAM_NAME >}}*, then the installer will update it.

::: {.notesection data-latex=""}
If updating a 32-bit edition of *{{< var PROGRAM_NAME >}}* (version 2021 or earlier), you will first need to uninstall the program.
The 64-bit editions default to the 64-bit *Windows* program folder, while earlier editions where installed to the "Program Files (x86)" folder.
Uninstalling any 32-bit editions will ensure that you won't have multiple installations after updating.

## Silent Mode {-}

The *{{< var PROGRAM_NAME >}}* installer uses *Inno Setup*, which provides support for silent install.
(This applies to both installation and upgrading.)
To perform a silent install, pass the command line arguments `/SILENT` or `/VERYSILENT`.
For example, the following will run a silent install that will not restart the computer and write its progress to a log file:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

rssetup.exe /SILENT /NORESTART /LOG
```
