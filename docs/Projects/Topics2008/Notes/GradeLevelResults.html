<hr>
<p>Most readability tests that
return a grade level include a decimal value, which
represents the month of the grade (e.g., "1.3" would be the third month
of first grade). However, it should be noted that this only applies to
tests that are computed from a mathematical formula. Tests that use
different methods--such as look-up tables and graphs--normally only
return a grade level without a decimal value.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="../Tests/DaleChall.html">Dale-Chall</a>
looks up the unfamiliar word and sentence count from a table and returns a grade
range. This will yield results such as "7-8", meaning that a document
falls within the seventh to eighth grade reading level.</p>

<p><a href="../Tests/LIX.html">LIX</a> and <a href="../Tests/RIX.html">RIX</a> use a similar method.
These tests calculate an index score and then look up the grade level
from a table using this value.</p>

<p>Finally, graphical tests (e.g., <a href="../Tests/Fry.html">Fry</a>)
only return grade levels because the "slices" on these graphs only
represent the grade, not the grade and month.</p>
