<hr>
<p>An incomplete sentence is defined as
a sentence that is not properly terminated with a period, exclamation
point, or question mark.</p>

<p>Beginning with <i>Readability Studio</i> 1.1, incomplete sentences, by default, are ignored for all newly created projects. That is to
say, any word considered to be inside an incomplete sentence
is not factored into any of the statistics or tests.
Incomplete sentences are not factored into the overall
sentence and paragraph counts, which in turn will also affect some
readability scores.</p>

<p>For compatibility, projects saved from versions prior to 1.1 will retain the original default behavior of
treating incomplete sentences as regular sentences and including them
in the analysis. To toggle this behavior for an existing project,
select <i>Project Settings...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to display the <i>Project Settings</i> dialog. Next,
click the <i>Document Analysis</i> icon, and select either
<i>Exclude from analysis</i> or <i>Include in
analysis and treat as full sentences</i> options, as illustrated
below.</p>

<p>Note that this option is also available on the <i>Options</i> dialog
(from the <i>Tools</i> menu) if you wish to change this
behavior for all future projects.</p>

<p>It is recommended to ignore
incomplete sentences because they are not usually
part of the document's main content, but rather dividers or sectional markers of
the content. Examples of incomplete sentences are section and chapter
titles, list items, and table of contents (often found in
technical documents and
<a href="../Examples/WebpageExample.html">webpages</a>).</p>

<p>One exception to the rule is when analyzing non-narrative (i.e.,
structured) forms. Documents such as r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and
application forms often contain a large number of terse and incomplete
sentences. In these situations, you would usually be more interested in using readability
tests that do not place emphasis on sentence length for these types of
files. Because of this, when you classify a document as a structured
form when creating a new project, incomplete sentences will always be
analyzed.</p>
