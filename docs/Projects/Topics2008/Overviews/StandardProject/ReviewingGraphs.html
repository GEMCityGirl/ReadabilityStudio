<p>After opening a project, click on the <i>Test Graphs &amp; Charts </i>icon
in project sidebar to view any readability tests that were
graphically plotted.</p>

<p>A <i>Word Breakdown</i> <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsGraphsBarChart.html">bar chart</a>
is always included with any project. It is basically a graph showing
the total counts of each type of word (e.g., 3+ syllable words) and how
each category compares to one another. This bar chart will appear like this:</p>

<p>In the above example we can see that there are 1,926 6+ character words, but
only 803 3+ syllable words. From this, we could quickly infer that to
lower the document's difficulty we should concentrate on replacing
words based on their length instead of (syllabic) complexity. Lists of
these words can be found by clicking on the <a href="ReviewingDifficultWords.html"><i>Difficult
Words</i></a> icon on the project sidebar.</p>

<p>There are two additional graphs that will be present if you had included the <a href="../ReviewingFryRaygor.html"><i>Fry</i></a>
or <a href="../ReviewingFryRaygor.html"><i>Raygor</i></a>
graph tests.</p>
