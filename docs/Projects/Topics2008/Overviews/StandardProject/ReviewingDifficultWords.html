<h1><font color="#315184"><b>Reviewing the Difficult Words List</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>After opening a project, click on the <i>Difficult Word</i>s
icon in project sidebar to view the lists of difficult words.</p>

<p>The types of difficult-word list that may be shown (depending on
which ones were selected from the <a href="CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">Project Wizard</a>)
are:</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>3+ syllable
words</b></font>: This list displays all of the words in
the document that are three or more syllables. It also displays how
many syllables each word contains and their respective frequency counts.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>6+ character
words</b></font>: This list displays all of the words in
the document that are six or more characters. It also displays how many
characters each word contains and their respective frequency counts.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>DC unfamiliar
words</b></font>: This list displays all of the words in
the document that are not in the <i>Dale-Chall</i>
familiar words list and their respective frequency counts. The <i>Dale-Chall</i>
word list is a collection of words that are considered to be familiar
to most fourth grade readers. Words in the document that are not found
on this list may be less familiar to younger readers and hence more difficult.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Spache
unfamiliar words</b></font>: This list displays all of the
words in the document that are not in the <i>Spache</i>
familiar words list and their respective frequency counts. The <i>Spache</i>
word list is a collection of words that are considered to be familiar
to most primary-age readers. Words in the document that are not found
on this list may be less familiar to younger readers and hence more
difficult.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>All words from
the document</b></font>: This list displays all of the
words from the document and their respective frequency counts.</p>

<p>Note that
if you are ignoring incomplete sentences, then these lists will only
include the words from complete sentences. If you need to review
all of the words from the document, then select the option <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysisSentencesWords.html#incompletesentences"><i>Include
in analysis and treat as full sentences</i></a>.
Please refer <a href="../../Notes/IncompleteSentences.html">here</a>
to learn more about how <i>Readability Studio</i> handles
incomplete sentences.</p>

<p>To view any of these lists, simply click on the tab strip:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wordliststab.png"></p>

<p>To find
the most complex words, sort the <i>Syllable count</i>
column of the <i>3+ syllable words</i> list. You can sort any of the
columns by clicking on the column
header. To change the sorting order to either ascending or descending,
click the column header a second time. As you can see below, the words
with the most syllables are now shown at the top of the list.</p>

<p>If your test scores are indicating that the document is too
difficult for your target audience, then you should review overly
complex or long words. You may consider seeing if any shorter synonyms
could be used in
their place. The same type of review can also be performed with the <i>6+
character words</i> list by sorting the <i>Letter count</i> column.</p>

<p>To help find the most difficult words for the <i>Dale-Chall</i>
list, select the <i>Dale-Chall</i>
tab and sort the <i>Frequency Count</i> column. The most
frequently occurring words are the ones that should be replaced with
more familiar synonyms that most readers would recognize.</p>

<p>To find a specific word in a list, go to the <i>Edit</i>
menu and select the <i>Find...</i> option. You can also select
the list and begin typing the word and the selection will move to the word
(if it is in the list).</p>

<p>Any of these lists can be printed or exported if you want to further review
them outside of <i>Readability Studio</i>. To print a
list, go to the <i>File</i> menu and select the <i>Print...</i>
option. To save a list, go to the <i>File</i> menu and
select the <i>Export hard word list...</i> option. You can
also find these options on the toolbar or by right clicking on a list.</p>
