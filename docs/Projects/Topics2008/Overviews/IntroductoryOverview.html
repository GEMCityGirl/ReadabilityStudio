<h3><u>Readability Formulas</u></h3>
<p>When writing for a target audience or&nbsp;classifying
existing documents for a particular age group, readability formulas are
invaluable tools. They help in determining the
minimum age group that is able to process reading material by using an
analytical approach. This approach uses variables
such as sentence length and difficult words, although some formulas
also use predefined dictionaries.</p>
		
<p>Readability scores are usually a
grade level or age that represents the youngest reader that can process
the material. These scores can also help you determine how easily a
more general audience can process it. For example, most magazine and
newspaper articles should aim for scores around the 14-16 age range.
This is not because most readers of newspapers are in this age group.
This is because it is not appropriate for this type of material to be
overly difficult. If news articles contain numerous complex and
uncommon words then they will take much longer to read and understand.
These are not characteristics appropriate for something that is
meant to be digested quickly by most readers.</p>
		
<p>It is important to note readability formulas can only determine the reading level of
material based on how easy it is to process. They do not take into
account the content or themes of the material. The age level
reported by a test score only reflects the age group that can
process the document. It does not reflect whether the
topics covered in the material are appropriate for any particular age
group. If you are classifying a book for a specific age
group, you should first review it for any mature topics. Then you should use readability formulas to determine its
comprehension level.</p>
