<p>The options on this tab enable you to customize your project's level of detail and how it connects to the document it is analyzing.</p>

<h3><u>Document linking and embedding</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Embed the
original document's text in the project file</b></font>:
Select this option to include the document's text directly into the
project. This option is useful if you do not want to reanalyze the
source document (if it has been altered) the next time you open the
project.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Reload the
source document when opening project</b></font>: Select
this option to reload and reanalyze the source document the next time
you open the project. Note that the source document's content will not
be stored in the project, so if the document can't be found
then only the results from the previous time the project was opened
will be shown.</p>

<h3><u><a name="statsdisplay"></a>Statistics display</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Minimal</b></font>:
Select this option to only include the most basic information in the statistics and
readability windows.</p>


<p><font color="#315184"><b>Medium</b></font>:
Select this option to include the most common statistics in the statistics and
readability windows.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Verbose</b></font>:
Select this option to include fully detailed information in the
statistics and readability windows.</p>
