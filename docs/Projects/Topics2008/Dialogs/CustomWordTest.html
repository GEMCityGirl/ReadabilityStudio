<h1><font color="#315184"><b>Custom Word Test</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>This dialog is used to edit or create a custom familiar word test.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Name of the
test</b></font>: If creating a new test, enter its name in
this field.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>File

the familiar-word list in this field.
This list must be a text file where each word is separated by a space, tab, comma, semicolon, or new line. An
example file would look like this:</p>

<p>or like this:</p>

<p><tt>computer,install,program,videogame</tt></p>

<p>or like this:</p>

<p><tt>computer<br>

install<br>

program<br>

videogame</tt></p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Familiar words</b></font>:
This list displays all of the words from your familiar-word file.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Associate with
document type</b></font>: Select the document types that
you want this test to be associated with when creating a new
project. This will only take effect if you choose to have the
project wizard select tests for you based on document type.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Associate with
industry</b></font>: Select the industries that you want
this test to be associated with when creating a new
project. This will only take effect if you choose to have the project wizard select
tests for you based on industry or field.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Also
include Dale-Chall familiar word list</b></font>:
Select this option to use the <a href="../Tests/DaleChall.html"><i>Dale-Chall</i></a>
word list in conjunction with your word list when determining if a word
is familiar.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Also
include Spache familiar word list</b></font>:
Select this option to use the <a href="../Tests/Spache.html">
<i>Spache</i></a> word list in conjunction with your word list when determining if a word
is familiar.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Familiar words
must appear on all included word lists</b></font>: Select
this option to consider words familiar only if they appear on your
custom list and other selected lists. This
option is only recommended for special situations where you would only
want to find words that appear within a union of your word list
and the <i>DC</i> and/or <i>Spache</i> word lists.</p>

<p>Note that this option is only
available if you are including the <i>Dale-Chall</i> and/or <i>Spache</i> word lists.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Also
treat proper nouns as familiar words</b></font>:
Treats proper nouns found in your documents as familiar words (in
conjunction with your word list).</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Also
treat numerals as familiar words</b></font>:
Treats numeric words found in your documents as familiar words (in
conjunction with your word list).</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Readability
formula</b></font>: Specifies which readability formula to
use when calculating the grade level for this test.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Use stemming
to search for similar words</b></font>: Specifies whether
or not to use stemming when comparing your familiar words with the
words in your document.</p>

<p>Stemming compares words based on
their root and is useful for finding words that might appear in a form
different from how they are entered in your familiar word list. For
example, let us say that you enter the word "installation" in
your familiar word file. If you select English as your stemming type, then
occurrences of the words "installation", "install", "installed",
"installs", etc. found in your document will be considered familiar.
This is because each of these words share the same root, "install". The
benefit of this is that you do not need to enter every form of every
word into your familiar word file.</p>

<p>If you are not using stemming, then
it is recommended that you enter each form of your words (e.g.,
possessive, plural) in your familiar word list.</p>
