<hr>
<p>The options on this tab enable you to specify how your documents should be parsed and analyzed.</p>

<h3><u>Consider sentences overly long if</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Longer than 20
words</b></font>: Select this option to highlight sentences
that are 20 words or longer in the "long sentences" window of the
document viewing area.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Outside of
sentence outlier range</b></font>:
Select this option to highlight sentences that are comparatively longer
than other sentences in the current document. These highlighted
sentences can be viewed in the "long sentences" window of the document
viewing area. This option is only recommended for situations where most
of the sentences are an acceptable length, but a few (very) long
sentences skew the average. This option is useful for finding
these type of sentences.</p>

<h3><u>Sentence deduction</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Ignore blank
lines when determining the end of a sentence</b></font>:
Select this option to not consider incomplete sentences followed by
blank lines as the end of the current sentence and paragraph. If an
incomplete sentence is encountered, any blank lines after it will be skipped and
the sentence will be merged with the following sentence.</p>

<p>This option is not recommended for documents that contain headers and lists that rely on blank lines to
separate them from the narrative text.</p>

<p>Also note that this option is disabled if <a href="#eol"><i>Always
treat an end of line as a new paragraph</i></a>
is selected. In this case, the end of a line will always indicate the
end of a sentence and paragraph, whether or not it is followed by blank
lines.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b><a name="SentCapt"></a>Sentences
must begin with capitalized words</b></font>: Select this option to have
sentence detection assume that all sentences begin with capitalized
words. By default, <i>Readability Studio</i>
takes into consideration writing which does not capitalize the first
word of every sentence. To change this behavior, select this option and
<i>Readability Studio</i> will be more grammatically strict when deducing sentences.</p>

<h3><u><a name="incompletesentences"></a>Incomplete Sentences</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Exclude from
analysis</b></font>: Select this option to ignore all
incomplete sentences when calculating statistics.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Include in
analysis and treat as full sentences</b></font>:
Select this option to treat all incomplete sentences as regular
sentences when calculating statistics. This is only useful for forms
that may contain numerous titles and lists items.</p>

<h3><u>End of paragraph</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Only treat an
end of line as a new paragraph if following a valid sentence</b></font>:
Select this option to only consider line feeds in the text as the end
of the current sentence and paragraph if it follows a valid sentence.
Multiple consecutive line feeds (normally indicating a header or
beginning of a new chapter) will also be considered the start of a new
paragraph.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b><a name="eol"></a>Always
treat an end of line as a new
paragraph</b></font>: Select this option to always consider
line feeds in the text as the end of the current sentence and
paragraph. This should only be used for special cases where a document
does not have any sort of paragraph indenting and contains
numerous lists and headers that do not have any blank lines between
them.</p>

<h3><u> Numeral syllabication</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Treat numeral
words as one syllable</b></font>: Select this option to
have the application consider numeric words (e.g., numbers, dates,
phone numbers) as monosyllabic.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Sound out each
digit</b></font>: Select this option to have the
application sound out each digit when counting the syllables of numeric
words (e.g., numbers, dates, phone numbers). For example, the word
"555-4778" will be considered nine syllables--read as
"five-five-five-four-seven-seven-eight". As another example, "$52" will
be considered four syllables--read as "five-two-dollars".</p>
