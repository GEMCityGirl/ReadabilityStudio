<hr>
<p>The <i><b>Revised Spache</b></i> readability formula calculates the U.S.
grade level of a text sample based on sentence length
and number of unfamiliar words. Unfamiliar words are ones that
do not appear on a specially designed list of common words that are
familiar to most younger readers (4th grade and below). Also,
numerals and proper nouns are considered familiar and
are not included in the overall unfamiliar word count.</p>

<p><b><i>Revised Spache</i></b> is generally used for primary age
(Kindergarten to 7th grade) readers to help classify school textbooks
and literature, whereas <a href="DaleChall.html">New Dale-Chall</a> is
better meant for secondary age readers.</p>

<p>Because this formula is based on the usage of familiar words (rather than
syllable or letter counts), it is often regarded as a more accurate
test for younger readers.</p>

<p>Note that the Spache word list and formula were revised in 1974 and this is the
version that <i>Readability Studio</i> uses.</p>

<h3><u>The Revised Spache Formula</u> </h3>

<blockquote>G = (.121 * S) +(.082 * U) + .659 </blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>U.S. grade level</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>S</td>
        <td>Average sentence length</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>Number of unique unfamiliar words</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>This test
requires a 100-word sample; however, note that Readability Studio
always analyzes your entire document to guarantee the most accurate
results and does not use subsamples for any of its test calculations.
If a formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>
