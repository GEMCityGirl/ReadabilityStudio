<hr>
<p>The <i><b>New Dale-Chall</b></i> readability
test calculates the U.S. grade level of a text sample
based on sentence length and the number of unfamiliar words.
Unfamiliar words are ones that do not appear on a specially designed
list of common words that are familiar to most 4th-grade
students. Also, numerals and proper nouns
are considered familiar and are not included in the overall unfamiliar word count.</p>

<p>The original familiar word list was only 763 words; however, Professors
Chall and Dale extended this list to 3,000 for the revised version of
this formula in 1995. Note that the revised version of this test is
what <i>Readability Studio</i> uses.</p>

<p>The <i><b>New Dale-Chall</b></i> test looks up its result
from a chart and returns a U.S. grade range
(e.g., "4" or "7-8"). This is an important difference
from other tests that use formulas
to calculate <a href="../Notes/GradeLevelResults.html">floating-point
precision</a> grade levels.</p>

<p>Because this formula is based on the usage of familiar words (rather than
syllable or letter counts), it is often regarded as a more accurate
test for younger readers.</p>
