<hr>
<p>In this example, we will analyze a&nbsp;literary novel to help determine
which age group it is most appropriate for (in terms of readability,
not content). The first step is to open the <i>New Project</i>
wizard and choose the book. Select <i>New Project...</i>
from the <i>File</i> menu to open the <i>New Project</i>
wizard, select the option <i>Read text from a file</i>,
and click the <i>Next</i> button.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizard1.png"></p>

<p>Next, you
will see the <i>Select File</i> dialog. You can either
type in the file path of the document or browse for it. Click the
button next to the file path field to browse for it:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/exampleselectfile.png"></p>

<p>This will
open the <i>Select Document to Analyze</i> dialog. Choose
the file that you want to analyze and click the <i>OK</i>
button to accept it:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/browseforfile.png"></p>

<p>You will
then return to the <i>Select File</i> dialog. Click the <i>Next</i>
button&nbsp;to proceed to the <i>Readability Tests</i>
dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardreadabilitymethods.png"></p>

<p>Because this is a literary work, select the <i>Recommend tests based on
document type</i> and click the <i>Next</i> button
to proceed to the <i>Select Document Type</i> dialog, as
shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizarddoctype.png"></p>

<p>Select the <i>Literature (young adult and adult)</i> option because we at least know that
this book is meant for older readers (rather than children) and click
the <i>Next</i> button. The next dialog will be the <i>Select
Highlighted Documents</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardtextselections.png"></p>

<p>Select all of the checkboxes so that we will have all of the highlighted text
views available. Click the <i>Next</i> button to proceed
to the <i>Select Difficult Words Lists</i> dialog, as
shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardlistsslections.png"></p>

<p>Select all
of the checkboxes so that we will have all of the difficult word lists
available and click the <i>Finish</i> button to begin
analyzing the project.</p>

<p>At this point we can review the test scores of the book (by clicking on the <i>Readability
Scores</i> icon on the project sidebar) to help determine which
reading age it is appropriate for. As we can see below, <u>Bram
Stoker's Dracula</u> appears to be readable for at least readers
in the 10-13 age (or above) range. This implies that it may be too
difficult for younger readers due to longer sentences and/or difficult words.</p>

<p>To help
understand why this book may be difficult for younger readers, click on
the <i>Difficult Words</i> icon on the project sidebar to
display various lists of difficult words. Select the <i>3+
syllable words</i> tab and click on the <i>Syllable Count</i>
column header twice to sort the words in descending order
(where the highest syllable words appear at the top of the list). As
illustrated below, there are many words containing six or more
syllables, which can be very difficult for most readers of any age.</p>

<p>If you are
an educator assigning this book to your students, you can
export the more difficult words to printout and discuss with
them. To do this, select <i>Export hard word list...</i>
from the <i>File</i> menu and use the <i>Save As...</i>
dialog to save this list to either an HTML or text file. You can also
do this with any of the other difficult word lists, such as the <i>Spache
unfamiliar words</i> list. Refer to <a href="VocabBuilderExample.html">example
2</a> for further details.</p>
