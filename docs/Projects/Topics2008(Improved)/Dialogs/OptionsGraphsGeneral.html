<p>The options on this tab allow you to customize your graphs.</p>

<h3><u>Graph window background</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Display color</b></font>:
Select this option to fill the background for your graphs with a
specified color.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Display image
file</b></font>: Select this option to display an image as
the background for your graphs.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Apply a color fade to the background</b></font>:
Select this option to apply a downward fade to the background color of
your graphs. The background of your graphs will fade (top-to-bottom)
starting with the display color that you have selected into white. Note
that this option will not apply if you are displaying an image for your
backgrounds instead of a color.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Background
opacity</b></font>: This option sets how transparent the background color or image is for
your graphs. Sliding this bar to the far right will set the background
to be fully opaque, whereas sliding it to the far left will set the
background to be blank.</p>

<h3><u>Watermarks &amp; Logos</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Watermark</b></font>: Enter a label to be stamped across your graphs in this field. This
label will be stamped diagonally across each graph, top left-hand
corner to bottom right-hand corner. The default font size for a watermark is 40 points, but will be scaled down (if necessary) so that the watermark fits properly.</p>
<p>This option is useful for stamping labels such as "<tt>CONFIDENTIAL</tt>" or your company name onto your graphs.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Logo</b></font>: Enter the path to the image file used as your graphs' logo in this text
box. The logo will be displayed in the lower right-hand corner of
each graph.</p>
<p>The logo will also have a light transparency added so that the underlying graph slightly shows through
it. If the image already has transparent pixels, then those pixels will
remain transparent. For example, PNG files support transparency and can
be used to create logos with rounded edges.</p>
<p>Note that watermarks and logos will also appear when you print or save a graph.</p>

<h3><u>Effects</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b><a name="dropshadow">Display drop shadows</a></b></font>: Check this option to include shadows underneath items such as boxes, bars, and labels.
Unchecking this option will give your graphs a more "flat" look.</p>
