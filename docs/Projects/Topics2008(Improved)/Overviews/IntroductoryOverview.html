<h3><u>Readability Formulas</u></h3>
<p>When writing for a target audience or classifying
documents for particular age groups, readability formulas are
invaluable tools. They help determine the
minimum age group that can quickly process reading material by using an
analytical approach. This approach uses factors
such as sentence length, word difficulty, and word familiarity.</p>

<p>Readability scores represent the
grade level or age of the youngest reader that can understand
a document. They can also determine how easily a
more general audience can process it. For example, most magazine and
newspaper articles should aim for scores around the 14-16 age range.
This is not because most readers of newspapers are in this age group.
It is because this type of material should be easy to read for most age groups.
If an article contains numerous complex and
uncommon words, then it will take much longer to read and understand.
It will also make it less enjoyable to read.
These are not qualities appropriate for something that is
meant to be read quickly by most readers.</p>

<p>Note that these tests only determine the reading level of
material based on how easy it is to process. They do not consider
the content or themes of the work. The age level
reported by a test score only reflects the age group that can
comprehend the document. It does not reflect whether the
topics covered in the material are meant for that age
group. If you are classifying a book into an age
group, you should first review it for any mature topics. Then you should use readability tests to determine its
comprehension level.</p>
