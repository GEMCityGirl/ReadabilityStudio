the Fry and Raygor Graphs</b></font></h1>
<hr>

<p>There are two readability tests that are graphically plotted, <a href="../Tests/Fry.html">
<i>Fry</i></a>
and <a href="../Tests/Raygor.html"><i>Raygor</i></a>.
These graphs are similar in most respects
and can be interpreted the same way. Both graphs consist of grade-level regions that the document
may fall within. They also both include indicators for the largest
factor for the reported grade level (i.e., word difficulty vs. sentence
difficulty).</p>

<p>To view these graphs, click on the <i>Test Graphs &amp;
Charts </i>icon in a <a href="StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">standard project</a> or the <i>Fry/Raygor Graphs</i>
icon in a <a href="BatchProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">batch project</a>.</p>

<p>Let us first review a <i>Fry</i> graph:</p>

<img alt="" src="../../Images/frygraph.png">

<p>To read
this graph, search for the red data point&ndash;this value represents the
document's score. Note that there are numbers 1 through 17+ on this
chart, each partitioned into small slices. The "slice" that the data
point falls into is the grade level of this document. In the example
above, the data point is inside of the 8th grade slice (notice that the
8 is marked in red).</p>

<p>Running through each slice is a gray line, which is a separator to help show
the most predominate cause of the document's difficulty. If the data
point is above the gray line, then the strongest influence on the
document's difficulty is high-syllable words. If it is below the line,
then the strongest influence is long sentences. In the above example,
it is above the line, implying that it is slightly more influenced by
high-syllable words. However, because it is fairly close to the line,
this document is well balanced between difficult words and difficult
sentences.</p>

<p>If the data point does not fall inside of a slice then the test will fail. For
example, the Raygor graph below indicates that the
document's overly long sentences caused the test to fail:</p>

<img alt="" src="../../Images/raygorbadgrade.png">

<p>The document was almost classified as 11th grade level material, but too
many long sentences caused it to be considered too difficult to be
assigned to any grade. At this point, you would want to review the
document's lengthy sentences (from the <i>Long Sentences</i>
tab of the <a href="StandardProject/ReviewingHighlightedText.html"><i>View Document</i></a>
area) and try to shorten some of them.</p>

<p>The <i>Fry</i> and <i>Raygor</i> graphs are
very similar and are both interpreted in the same manner; however,
there are a few differences between them. The <i>Fry</i>
graph classifies documents within the 1st grade to doctorate level. In
contrast, <i>Raygor</i>
concentrates on the range of 3rd grade to the sophomore collegiate
level. It is recommended to only use <i>Raygor</i> graphs
for materials targeted for secondary-age readers.</p>

<p>Another difference is that the <i>Fry</i>
graph is influenced by high-syllable words, while the <i>Raygor</i>
graph is influenced by long words (words with six or more characters). Long
sentences remain a key factor for both of these graphs, though.</p>

<p>The other difference between the two graphs is that they are inverted from one
another. In a <i>Fry</i> graph, the long-sentence region is in the bottom left-hand corner (going
downward), whereas in a <i>Raygor</i>
graph the long-sentence region is in the top left-hand corner (going
upward). However, the same rules apply for how to interpret the grade
level and influence of difficult words vs. difficult sentences.</p>

<p>As a final note, if you plot either a <i>Fry</i>
or <i>Raygor</i> graph, the final results can also be viewed in the <a href="StandardProject/ReviewingScores.html"><i>Readability
Scores</i></a> area.</p>
