<hr>
<p>How sentences are structured can vary from document to document. Because of this, <i>Readability
Studio</i> offers options to control how sentences are parsed and analyzed. These
features are available under the <i>Sentence
deduction</i> section of the <a href="../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysis.html"><i>Document
Analysis</i></a> page. To view these features, select <a href="../Overviews/OptionsAndSettingsOverview.html"><i>Options</i></a> from
the <i>Tools</i> menu and then click on the <i>Document
Analysis</i> icon. Under the <i>Sentence deduction</i>
section, there are two options: <i>Ignore
blank lines when determining the end of a sentence</i> and <i>Sentences must begin with
capitalized words</i>.</p>

<p>The option <i>Sentences must begin with
capitalized words</i> controls
whether sentences must begin with capitalized words. Selecting
this option will make <i>Readability
Studio</i> more grammatically strict when counting sentences; however, it is
recommended to leave this option unselected for "loosely written"
documents.</p>

<p>The option <i>Ignore blank lines...</i> is used for controlling how
multi-line sentences with blank lines between them are seen. For example:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;Chapter 1<br>
<br>
It was the best days of our lives.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>If <i>Ignore blank lines...</i> is unselected (the
default), then the above example is seen as two sentences. "<i>Chapter
1</i>" is seen as an <a href="../Notes/IncompleteSentences.html">incomplete
sentence</a> because there is a blank line between it
and the next sentence. Then "<i>It was the best days of our
lives.</i>" is seen as the second sentence. This behavior is
recommended for most documents because it helps remove headers and list
items from the analysis.</p>

<p>There are
special situations where you would need multi-line sentence fragments
to be "<a href="LineChaining.html">chained</a>" together. For example, picture books that wrap
sentences around images may cause sentences to be split into fragments
with blank lines between them. Let us review an example of this.</p>

<p>From the <i>Help</i>
menu, select the <i>Examples</i> menu and then select <u>The
Tale of Peter Rabbit</u>. From the <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">project wizard</a>,
select <i>Children's literature</i> and then choose the
defaults after that. Next, click on the <i>View
Document</i> icon on the project sidebar to view the
document. If <i>Ignore blank lines...</i> was unselected, then note
how some sentences have been split into incomplete fragments:</p>

<p>To see what
is happening here, we will open the original document. From the <i>File</i>
menu, select <i>Open Source Document</i>
to open this example in a web browser. As we can see below, the
sentence in question is split into multiple lines. Part of it is
on top of an image, and the rest of it is split across multiple
lines to fit next to the image.</p>

<p>To correct this, we will change how sentences are deduced for this project. Select <i>Project
Settings</i> from the <i>File</i> menu and then click on <i>Document
Analysis</i> icon. Then select the option <i>Ignore
blank lines...</i> and click <i>OK</i>. Note that by
changing this option from the <i>Project
Setting</i> dialog, this will only affect this project, not any other
projects.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/IgnoreBlankLines.png"></p>

<p>At this point, the project will be reanalyzed and these sentence fragments
will be chained together:</p>
