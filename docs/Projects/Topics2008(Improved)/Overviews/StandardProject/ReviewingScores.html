<hr>
<p>After opening a project, click on the <i>Readability Scores</i>
icon on the project sidebar to view all the test scores, as well as
their respective explanations and recommendations.</p>

<p>The top area of the <i>Readability Scores</i> window is the score
grid. In here there are four columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Test</i>:
the name of the readability test</li>

  <li><i>U.S.
Grade Level</i>: the grade level that the test determined the
document is suitable for</li>

  <li><i>Reader
Age</i>: the reader's age that the test determined the document
is suitable for</li>

  <li><i>Scale
Value</i>: the score value for tests that use special scales</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that
most tests have just one&nbsp;type of result (e.g., grade level),
so non-applicable columns are left blank. For example, note below that
the <a href="../../Tests/GunningFog.html"><i>Gunning Fog</i></a>
result is a U.S. grade level of 9.1. This translates to a
ninth grade level reader (in his or her first month of class). Because
this test returns a U.S. grade level and age and does not use
any a scale, the <i>Scale Value</i> column is empty.
Another example is the result for the <a href="../../Tests/Flesch.html"><i>Flesch
Reading Ease</i></a>
test, which is a scale value 0f 80. This test has its own scale,
instead of a grade level, so its age and grade level columns are empty.</p>

<p>Select any
test in the results grid to display an explanation of its score in the
window below.</p>

<p> <img alt="" src="../../../Images/scores.png"></p>

<p>Along with
an explanation of the test's results, tips are also provided for how to
lower the score, as well as a summary of what type of text this
test is appropriate for.</p>

<p>Finally, the averages (means) of your test
scores and ages are displayed at the bottom of the results window. Their
respective medians and standard deviations are also
included if your <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsProjectSettings.html#statsdisplay">statistics
level of detail</a> is set to <i>verbose</i>.
Note that when calculating these statistics, failed test scores are treated as missing observations and not included.
For example, let us say that you included 5 tests, but one of them could not be calculated. In this case, the valid 4 scores will be added and divided by 4 (not 5) to acquire the means.</p>

<p>Some special scores will also be converted when being aggregated into these statistics. The value "college+" found in
<a href="../../Tests/LIX.html">LIX</a> will be seen as 13 when factored into these statistics.
Also, grade ranges such as "5-6" from <a href="../../Tests/DaleChall.html">Dale-Chall</a> will be converted to its own average (e.g., "5-6" will be 5.5).</p>

<p>To remove any test in this list from the project, select it and press the <tt>DELETE</tt> button.</p>

<p>This window can be <a href="../Printing.html">printed</a> or <a href="../Exporting.html">exported</a>.</p>
