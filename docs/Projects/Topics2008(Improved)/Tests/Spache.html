<hr>
<p>The <i><b>Revised Spache</b></i> test calculates the U.S.
grade level of a document based on sentence length
and number of unfamiliar words. This test uses a list of common words that are
familiar to most younger readers (4th grade and below). Any word in a document that
does not appear on this list is considered unfamiliar. Note that all
numerals and proper nouns are also considered familiar.</p>

<p><b><i>Revised Spache</i></b> is generally used for primary age* readers to help classify school textbooks
and literature. This differs from <a href="DaleChall.html">New Dale-Chall</a>, which is
better meant for secondary age readers.</p>

<p>Because this formula uses familiar words (rather than
syllable or letter counts), it is often regarded as a more accurate
test for younger readers.</p>

<p>Note that <i>Readability Studio</i> uses the revised 1974 version of Spache.</p>

<h3><u>The Revised Spache Formula</u> </h3>

<blockquote>G = (.121 * S) +(.082 * U) + .659 </blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>

<blockquote>
  <table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>G</td>
        <td>U.S. grade level</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>S</td>
        <td>Average sentence length</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>U</td>
        <td>Number of unique unfamiliar words</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</blockquote>

<p>This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results.
Note that <i>Readability Studio</i> analyzes your entire document and does not
use subsamples for its test calculations. If a
formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>
