<p>The <i><b>Raygor Estimate Graph</b></i> is a graphical test for English
text, developed by Alton L. Raygor in 1977.</p>

<p>The U.S. grade level is calculated by the average number of
sentences and letters per hundred words. These averages are plotted
onto a specific graph where their intersection determines the
reading level of the content. Note that this graph is very similar to the <a href="Fry.html">Fry graph</a>.</p>

<p>This graph is primarily used in secondary education to help
classify teaching materials and books into their appropriate reading groups.
Below is an example of a <i><b>Raygor graph</b></i>
as it appears in <i>Readability Studio</i>:</p>

<p>The <i><b>Raygor Estimate Graph</b></i> formula is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Extract a 100-word passage from the selection. If the
material is long, take subsamples from the beginning, middle, and end.</li>

<li>Count the number of sentences in each passage. Count a half
sentence as .5.</li>

<li>Count the number of words in each passage containing six or
more letters.</li>

<li>Find the point on the Raygor Estimate Graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results.
Note that <i>Readability Studio</i> analyzes your entire document and does not
use subsamples for its test calculations. If a
formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>
