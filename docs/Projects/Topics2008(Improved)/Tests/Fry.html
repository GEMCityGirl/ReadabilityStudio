<p>The <b><i>Fry Graph</i></b> is a graphical test for English
text, developed by Dr. Edward Fry in 1977.</p>
		
<p>The U.S. grade level is calculated by the average number of
sentences and syllables per hundred words. These averages are plotted
onto a specific graph where their intersection determines the
reading level of the content. Note that this graph is similar to the <a href="Raygor.html">Raygor
graph</a>.</p>
		
<p>The <b><i>Fry graph</i></b> is
designed for most text&ndash;including literature and technical
documents&ndash;and can be used for both primary and secondary age
reading materials. Below is an example of a <i><b>Fry graph</b></i>
as it appears in <i>Readability Studio</i>:</p>

<p>The <i><b>Fry Graph</b></i> formula is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract a 100-word passage from the selection. If the
material is long, take subsamples from the beginning, middle, and end.</li>

<li>Count the number of sentences in each passage. Count a half
sentence as .5.</li>

<li>Count the number of words in each passage containing three
or more syllables.</li>

<li>Find the point on the Fry Graph.</li>

</ul>
		
<p>This test is designed for 100-word samples, with 3 samples being recommended for best results.
Note that <i>Readability Studio</i> analyzes your entire document and does not
use subsamples for its test calculations. If a
formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>
		
<p>Also, note that numerals and proper nouns are always ignored
for this test, so <i>Readability
Studio</i> always ignores your numeral syllabication setting
when calculating this test.</p>
