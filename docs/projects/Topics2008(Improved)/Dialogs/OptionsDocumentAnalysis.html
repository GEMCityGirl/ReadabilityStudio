<hr>
<p>The options here enable you to specify how your documents should be parsed and analyzed.</p>

<h3><u>Consider sentences overly long if</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Longer than [20]
words</b></font>: Select this option to consider sentences
overly long if they exceed the word count specified in this field. The default word count
is 20, but can be changed as needed.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Outside
sentence outlier range</b></font>:
Select this option to consider sentences overly long if they are comparatively longer
than other sentences in the document.
This option is only recommended for situations where most
of the sentences have an acceptable length, but a few (very) long
sentences skew the average. This option is useful for finding these extreme sentences.</p>

<p>These sentences can be viewed in the <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/Grammar/ReviewingLongSentencesAndWordiness.html">"Long Sentences &amp; Wordiness"</a>
and <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/Grammar/ReviewingLongSentences.html">"Long Sentences"</a> windows in the <i>Grammar</i> section.</p>

<h3><u>Sentence deduction</u></h3>
<p><a name="ignoreblankline"><font color="#315184"><b>Ignore blank
lines when determining the end of a sentence</b></font></a>:
Select this option to not consider <a href="../Notes/IncompleteSentences.html">incomplete sentences</a> followed by
blank lines as the end of the current sentence and paragraph. If an
incomplete sentence is encountered, any blank lines after it will be skipped and
the sentence will be merged with the following sentence.</p>

<p>This option is not recommended for documents that contain headers or lists that rely on blank lines to
separate them from the narrative text. Refer to <a href="../Notes/LineChaining.html">line chaining</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Also note that this option is disabled if <a href="#eol"><i>Always
treat an end of line as a new paragraph</i></a>
is selected. In this case, line feeds will always indicate the
end of a sentence and paragraph, whether or not it is followed by blank
lines.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b><a name="SentCapt"></a>Sentences
must begin with capitalized words</b></font>: Select this option to have
sentence detection assume that all sentences begin with capitalized
words. By default, <i>Readability Studio</i>
takes into consideration writing that does not capitalize the first
word of every sentence. To change this behavior, select this option and
the program will be more grammatically strict when deducing sentences.</p>

<h3><u><a name="incompletesentences"></a>Incomplete Sentences</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Exclude from
analysis</b></font>: Select this option to ignore all
incomplete sentences when calculating statistics.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Include in
analysis and treat as full sentences</b></font>:
Select this option to treat all incomplete sentences as regular
sentences when calculating statistics. This is only recommended for forms
that may contain numerous titles and lists items and little narrative text. Refer to
<a href="../Notes/FragmentedText.html">fragmented text</a> for more information.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Treat trailing copyright notices as incomplete sentences</b></font>:
Select this option to ignore copyright/trademark notices at the end of the document when calculating statistics. This option
is only available if incomplete sentences are being excluded.</p>

<h3><u>End of paragraph</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Only treat an
end of line as a new paragraph if following a valid sentence</b></font>:
Select this option to only consider a line feed as the end
of the current sentence and paragraph if it follows a valid sentence.
This option is recommended for text that is formatted to a specific width
(e.g., scanned documents).</p>

<p>Two exceptions are made here. The first exception is for consecutive line feeds&ndash;these will always be considered the
start of a new paragraph. Consecutive line feeds normally indicate a title or chapter header
that should be separated from the following paragraph.</p>

<p>The second exception is if the line following a line feed is tabbed or bulleted&ndash;this will also
indicate the start of a new paragraph. In narrative text, the first sentence of a paragraph
is usually tabbed or spaced over. Also, items in a list are usually tabbed or bulleted. In both
cases, the program will recognize these as new paragraphs.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b><a name="eol"></a>Always
treat an end of line as a new
paragraph</b></font>: Select this option to always consider
line feeds in the text as the end of the current sentence and
paragraph. This should only be used for special cases where a document
does not have paragraph indenting and contains
numerous lists or headers that are not followed by blank lines.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="../Notes/LineChaining.html">line chaining</a> for more information
about these options.</p>

<a name="numsyllable"><h3><u> Numeral syllabication</u></h3></a>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Count numeral
words as one syllable</b></font>: Select this option to
have the program consider numeric words (e.g., numbers, dates,
phone numbers) as monosyllabic.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Sound out each
digit</b></font>: Select this option to have the
program sound out each digit when counting the syllables of numeric
words. For example, the word "555-4778" will be considered nine syllables&ndash;read as
"five-five-five-four-seven-seven-eight". As another example, "$52" will
be considered four syllables&ndash;read as "five-two-dollars".</p>
