<p>The options on this tab enable you to customize your general project settings.</p>

<h3><u>Document linking and embedding</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Embed the
original document's text in the project file</b></font>:
Select this option to save the source document's text directly into the
project. When you open this project, it will not reanalyze
your document. If your document has been edited, then those changes will be not
be reflected in this project.</p>

<p>This is useful for analyzing a "snapshot" of your
work. For example, you could analyze an early draft of your work and have it embedded in
the project. As you edit your work, opening this project will still show the results from
the original draft. From here, you can create a new project for your revised work and compare
its results against your early draft.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Reload the
source document when opening project</b></font>: Select
this option to reload and reanalyze the source document the next time
you open the project. Note that the source document's content will not
be stored in the project. If the document cannot be found,
then only the results from the previous analysis
will be shown.</p>

<h3><u><a name="statsdisplay"></a>Statistics level of detail</u></h3>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Minimal</b></font>:

Select this option to include the most common statistics in the statistics and
readability windows.</p>
