<hr>
		
<p>The <i><b>FORCAST</b></i>
readability formula was devised for assessing U.S. army
technical manuals and forms. It is the only test not designed for
running narrative, so it is mostly appropriate for multiple-choice
quizzes, applications, entrance forms, etc. This test calculates the US
grade level of a text sample based on its number of monosyllabic words.</p>

<p>Note that <i><b>FORCAST</b></i>
results may be slightly different from other tests because
it does not take sentence length into account. If your document is
structured mostly with tables and lists then expect there to be some variance between the <i><b>FORCAST</b></i>
grade level and other tests' grade levels.</p>

<h3><u>The FORCAST Formula</u></h3>
<blockquote>G = 20-(M/10)
</blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>

<blockquote>
<table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
<td>U.S. grade level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>M</td>
<td>Number of monosyllabic words</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>This test is designed for a minimum of a 150-word sample.
Note that <i>Readability Studio</i> analyzes your entire document and does not
use subsamples for its test calculations. If a
formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>
