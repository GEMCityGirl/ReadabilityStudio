<h1><font color="#315184"><b>Example 4: Analyzing a Webpage</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>In this example, we will create a project that reads and analyzes a webpage.
Although you can save a webpage from your web browser and load the HTML
file, <i>Readability Studio</i> also has the convenient
ability to directly connect to a webpage. To do this, open the webpage from any web browser and
copy the webpage's URL onto the clipboard.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/webbrowser.png" alt="web browser"></p>

<p>Next, we will create a new project using this URL. There are two ways to
accomplish this. The first is to click the <i>New
Project from Clipboard...</i> button on the toolbar. This option
will take what is currently on the clipboard and use it as the input
for a new project. If you have a large block of text on the clipboard,
then that will be what is analyzed. However, if you have a local file
path or URL on the clipboard, then the project will load the file or
webpage.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/pastebutton.png" alt="paste button"></p>

<p>The other
option is to click the <i>New Project...</i> button,
select <i>Read text from a file or webpage</i>, and enter
the URL in the file path field, as illustrated below.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/webpath.png" alt="web path"></p>

<p>After
specifying the URL, choose to analyze the page by document type and
then select <i>Technical document</i>. Most webpages would
fall under the category of either general or technical document. Because this page discusses
the&nbsp;subject of the Linux operating system, we will select technical.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/wizarddoctypetechselected.png" alt="wizard page"></p>

<p>Next,
accept the rest of the defaults on the <i>New Project</i>
wizard. Once the project is finished loading, click on the <i>View
Document</i> icon to display the highlighted content of the
webpage.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/incompletesentences.png" alt="incomplete sentences"></p>

<p>Note how some text is highlighted gray. These are <a href="../Notes/IncompleteSentences.html">incomplete sentences</a>,
and because <i>Readability Studio</i>, by default, ignores
incomplete sentences, nothing highlighted gray is factored into the
analysis. That is, nothing highlighted gray here counts towards
the overall sentence, paragraph, and word totals and are also not
included in any readability test calculation. Aside from
non-narrative forms, it is normally recommended to ignore incomplete
sentences. This is especially true for webpages, because often HTML
tables and lists are used on websites to display menus--items that are
not normally part of the page's narrative.</p>

<p>If you wish to include incomplete sentences in the analysis, select <i>Project
Settings...</i> from the <i>File</i> menu to display
the <i>Project Properties</i> dialog. Next, click the <i>Document
Analysis</i> icon, and select the <i>Include in analysis
and treat as full sentences</i> option.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/excludeincompletesentences.png" alt="exclude"></p>

<p>Note that
this option is also available on the <i>Options</i>
dialog (from the <i>Tools</i> menu) if you wish to change
this behavior for all future projects.</p>

<p>One last
item to discuss about loading a webpage is whether you want to be able
to reload it later on. By default, the original text from the website
will be saved into your project, and whenever you open this project,
the results will be based off the original page. If you prefer to be
able to reload the page (perhaps because it is a dynamic page that
periodically changes), then select <i>Project Properties...</i>
from the <i>File</i> menu to display the <i>Project
Settings</i> dialog. Then click the <i>Document Analysis</i>
icon, and select the <i>Reload the source document when opening
project</i> option.</p>

<p><img src="../../Images/reloadwebpage.png" alt="reload"></p>

<p>By
selecting this option, you will reload the page's content when
you reopen the project (or at anytime by pressing <b>F5</b>).</p>

<p>Note that
webpages requiring
authentication (i.e., requiring a user name and password) are not
currently supported. To work around this, log into the webpage from any
browser, save the page as a local HTML file, and then load it in a new
project.</p>
