<h1><font color="#315184"><b>Example 3: Analyzing a Work in Progress</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>In this example, we will analyze a recipe that we are working on for a
middle school home economics class. Our target age group will be
sixth-seventh grade reading and we will use <i>Readability Studio</i>
to help us achieve this. The first step is to open the <i>New Project</i> wizard
and select the book. Select <i>New Project...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to open the <i>New Project</i> wizard, select the option <i>Read text from a file</i>,
and click the <i>Next</i> button.</p>
		
<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizard1.png"></p>
		
<p>Next, you will see the <i>Select File</i>
dialog. You can either type in the file path of the document or browse
for it. Click the button next to the file path text box to browse for it:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/exampleselectfile.png"></p>

<p>This will open the <i>Select
Document to Analyze</i>
dialog. Choose the file that you want to analyze and click the <i>OK</i> button to
accept it:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/browseforfileexample2.png"></p>

<p>You will then return to the <i>Select File</i> dialog. Click the <i>Next</i>
button to proceed to the <i>Select Document Structure</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizarddocstructure.png"></p>

<p>On this dialog, we will specify how this document is formatted. The first option, <i>Narrative text</i>, is meant
for documents that consists of the standard sentence and paragraph structure. The second option, <a href="../Notes/LineChaining.html"><i>Narrative text (fragmented)</i></a>,
is the same as narrative text, except that some of the sentences may have unusual multiline formatting. The third option, <a href="../Notes/FragmentedText.html"><i>Non-narrative text</i></a>,
is meant for documents that contain very few sentences and mostly consist of sentence fragments.</p>

<p>This document does have some headers and list items in it (which are sentence fragments). However, we are not interested
in analyzing these fragments, and the document does contain a fair amount of narrative text that we are interested in. Because of this,
the <i>Non-narrative text</i> is not a candidate.</p>

<p>This document contains narrative text, and this text does not have any unusual multiline formatting. Therefore, the
<i>Narrative text (fragmented)</i> option is not a candidate.</p>

<p>This leaves the option <i>Narrative text</i>. This option applies to most documents, and this option does describe
our recipe. Select <i>Narrative text</i> and click the <i>Next</i> button to
proceed to the <i>Readability Tests</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardreadabilitymethods.png"></p>

<p>This file does not belong to any particular industry, but we do know that it
is an instructional document. Select the <i>Recommend tests based on
document type</i> and click the <i>Next</i> button to
proceed to the <i>Select Document Type</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizarddoctypeformselected.png"></p>

<p>Because this is an instructional document containing small narrative blocks, we
will consider this to be a technical document. Select <i>Technical document or form</i> and click the <i>Next</i>
button. The next dialog will be the <i>Select Highlighted Documents</i>
dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardtextselections.png"></p>

<p>Select all the checkboxes so
that we will have all the highlighted text views available.
Click the <i>Next</i>
button to proceed to the <i>Select
Difficult Words Lists</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardlistsslections.png"></p>

<p>Select all the checkboxes so
that we will have all the difficult word lists available and click
the <i>Finish</i>
button to begin analyzing the project.</p>

<p>At this point we can review the test scores of the recipe to determine which
reading age it is appropriate for. Click on the <i>Readability Scores</i>
icon in project sidebar to display the scores. As we can see below, it appears to
be readable for at least readers in the seventh to eighth grade
range or above. This is higher than our target audience and we may need
to make some improvements to this recipe to make it easier to read.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/scoresexample2.png"></p>

<p>To help understand why this recipe may be difficult for younger
readers, click on the <i>Difficult
Words</i> icon on the project sidebar. This will display various lists of
difficult words. Select the <i>6+ character words</i> tab and click on the <i>Character count</i>
column header twice to <a href="../Overviews/ColumnSorting.html">sort</a> the words in descending order. As illustrated
below, there are many words containing ten or more characters, which
can be very difficult for most readers. Also, when looking at the <i>3+ syllable words</i>
tab we can see that many of these same words also have high syllable
counts and are rather difficult.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/sixcharwordstab.png"></p>

<p>To view these words in their original context, click on the <i>View Document</i> icon on the project sidebar and then click on the <i>6+ character words</i>
tab, as illustrated below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/sixcharacterhighlightedwords.png"></p>

<p>You can click on any of the other tabs to view other difficult
words in their original context, such as 3+ syllable words or
unfamiliar Dale-Chall words.</p>

<p>To begin simplifying this recipe we will open the original document in Microsoft&reg; Wordpad and
begin replacing some of these difficult words. Words such as
"one-hundred-and-sixty-five" could be shortened to "165", and difficult
words such as "disseminate", "incorporate", "epidermis", "abdominal ",
and "transparent" could also be replaced with shorter, simpler
synonyms. As illustrated below, we have replaced a few words,
such as substituting "chest" for "abdominal", "skin" for "epidermis",
"use" for "utilize", etc.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/improvedwords.png"></p>

<p>The next item to review is the overly long sentences. Click on the <i>View Document</i> icon on the project sidebar and then click on the <i>Long Sentences</i>
tab, as illustrated below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/longsentences.png"></p>

<p>As we scroll through this window, we can see a few sentences that are
highlighted because they are overly long. Now we will return to the
original document and remove some wordiness from the first
sentence:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/improvedsentences.png"></p>

<p>Another sentence is a run-on sentence and is better off being split
into two separate sentences, as shown below:</p>
		
<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/improvedsentences2.png"></p>

<p>After we are finished reworking the original document, we will want to
analyze it again to see if it now meets our target audience. Rather
than starting all over again my making a new project, we will link this
project directly to the recipe document. By default, <i>Readability Studio</i> saves
the document's original text in the project; however, we can change
this so that the project instead links to the source document. Whenever we open the project, it will
reload and reanalyze the recipe document. To do this, select <i>Project Properties...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to open the <i>Properties</i>
dialog. Select the <i>Document Analysis </i>icon and then select the option <i>Reload the source document when
opening project</i>. Click the <i>OK</i> button to accept.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/linktofile.png"></p>

<p>Click the <i>Reload</i> button on the toolbar (as shown below), or select it from the <i>Edit</i> menu. <i>Readability Studio</i>
will now reload the recipe document, meaning that all the improvements that we had
previously made will now be imported into the project. As you can see
below, our grade level scores now fall within our target audience and
this recipe will be far more readable for our home economics class.</p>
		
<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/improvedscores.png"></p>

<p>Note that you can click the <i>Reload</i>
button at anytime to reanalyze the source document as you edit it
externally. Also, whenever you open this project it will
automatically reload the source document (in this case the recipe file).</p>
