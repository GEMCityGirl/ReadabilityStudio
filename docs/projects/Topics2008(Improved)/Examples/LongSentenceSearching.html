5: Searching for Overly Long Sentences</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>In this example, we will review a document for overly long sentences. This
example will demonstrate the available methods for defining
what an overly long sentence. In addition, it will also demonstrate how to
search for and review these sentences.</p>

<p>The first step is to open the example file <i>Features</i>.
From the <i>Help</i> menu, select the <i>Examples</i>
submenu and then select <i>Features</i>.</p>

<p>You will then presented with the <i>Readability Tests</i>
dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardreadabilitymethods.png"></p>

<p>Select the <i>Recommend tests based on document type</i> and click the <i>Next</i> button
to proceed to the <i>Select Document Type</i> dialog, as
shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizarddoctypetechselected.png"></p>

<p>Select the <i>Technical document</i> option and click
the <i>Next</i> button. The next dialog will be the <i>Select
Highlighted Documents</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardtextselections.png"></p>

<p>Select all the checkboxes so that we will have all the highlighted text
views available. Click the <i>Next</i> button to proceed
to the <i>Select Difficult Words Lists</i> dialog, as
shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/wizardlistsslections.png"></p>

<p>Select all the checkboxes so that we will have all the difficult word lists
available and click the <i>Finish</i> button to begin
analyzing the project.</p>

<p>If you are excluding <a href="../Notes/IncompleteSentences.html">incomplete
sentences</a> (the default) then this warning message
will be displayed.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/sentencewarning.png"></p>

<p>Because this file contains numerous incomplete sentences, <i>Readability
Studio</i> will ask you if excluding them is what you truly intend. In
this case, these sentences are just list items that we should ignore,
so select <i>No</i>.</p>

<p>Once the project is loaded, the
readability scores will be presented. As we can see below, this
document scores high within the collegiate range.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuresscores.png"></p>

<p>This document should be an easy to
read list of software features intended for a broad range of readers.
These scores are a bit too high, so now we will explore some the
document to understand why it is so difficult to read. Select the <i>Statistics</i>
icon in the project sidebar to view the document's statistics.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuresstats.png"></p>

<p>As we can see, there are some very
long sentences in this document and is probably the biggest factor in
our scores. To view a list of these sentences, click the <i>difficult sentences</i>
link. You can also click the <i>Grammar</i> icon in the sidebar and select the <i>Long Sentences</i> tab.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentencelist.png"></p>

<p>This list can be sorted alphabetically, by word count, or by location. To view any sentence in its
original context, double click on it. This will take you to the <i>Long Sentences &amp; Wordiness</i>
tab. In this window, all the overly long sentences and wordy phrases are highlighted
and each sentence displays its respective word count after it (in parenthesis).</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentences.png"></p>

<p>By default, the program
considers sentences being overly long if they contain more
than 20 words. As we can see, there are a few sentences that are
only a few words longer than 20 words that are not so problematic.
However, there are a few sentences clustered which exceed 40
words. At this point, we will want to temporarily filter out the
smaller of these long sentences and search for the "worst offenders".
From the <i>File</i> menu, select <i>Project
Settings</i> and then select the <i>Document Analysis</i>
icon. As shown below, we have a couple of different ways to determine
if a sentence is overly long:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentoptions.png"></p>

<p>The first option is to define a specific word count as the long sentence
boundary. Enter "25" where it says <i>Longer
than 20 words</i> and click the <i>OK</i> button.
The program will now reanalyze the file, considering that any
sentence longer than 25 (instead of 20) are overly long. As shown
below, sentences that are between 21-25 words are no longer being
classified as overly long:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentences25.png"></p>

<p>The second option is to consider sentences overly long if they are comparatively
longer than other sentences in the document. From the <i>File</i>
menu, select <i>Project Properties</i>
and then select the <i>Document Analysis</i> icon. Select the option <i>Outside
sentence-length outlier range</i> and click the <i>OK</i> button. At
this point, the boundary for overly-long sentences will be calculated based
on the outlier range of the sentence lengths. After reanalyzing the
file, note how the only sentences highlighted have the lengths of 45
and 48. These are the two "worst offenders" and should be either
reworded or split into small sentences.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentencesoutliers.png"></p>

<p>To see what the outlier range is, click on the <i>Statistics</i>
icon in the project sidebar. Here we can see that any sentence more
than 43 words is considered overly long.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/featuressentences43.png"></p>

<p>This option is only recommended for
situations where most of the sentences are an acceptable length, but a
few (very) long sentences skew the average. This option is
useful for finding these type of extreme sentences.</p>
