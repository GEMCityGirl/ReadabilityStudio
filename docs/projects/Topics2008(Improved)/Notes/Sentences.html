Sentences are Counted</b></font></h1>

considers periods, question marks, exclamation points, and
ellipses that follow a valid word as the end of a sentence, although
there are a couple of exceptions.</p>

<p>The first exception are periods
that are considered to be part of an abbreviation, acronym, or initial.
For example, the following is seen as
only one sentence:</p>

<p><tt>Jane B. Doe has worked at A.C.M.E., inc. for seven years.</tt></p>

<p>The other exception is the last sentence inside of a
quote. If this sentence is followed by a lowercase word, then this
sentence will not end until the next sentence terminating punctuation is
encountered. For example, the following is seen as two sentences:</p>

<p><tt>"Where did it go? I can't find it anywhere!" he said.</tt></p>

<p>Because "he" is lowercase, the '!'
will not be considered the end of the sentence and "he said" will be
considered part of the proceeding sentence. However, if "He" is
capitalized, then the '!' will be seen as the end of a sentence and the
above will be counted as three sentences.</p>

<p>One last special scenario is when a colon is found at the end of a
line. In this case, this will be seen as the end of a sentence because
it is assumed that this sentence is leading into a list. If a colon is
found in the middle of a sentence and is not at the end of a line, then it will not be
considered the end of the sentence.</p>

<p>By default,
lowercase words can be seen as beginning a new sentence.
Although it is poor grammar to not capitalize the first word of a
sentence, this writing style is often found in some literature. Note
that this does not apply if the sentence
terminating-punctuation proceeds a quotation mark, as discussed
previously. This behavior can be toggled using the option <a href="../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysis.html#SentCapt"><i>Sentences
must begin with capitalized words</i></a>.</p>
