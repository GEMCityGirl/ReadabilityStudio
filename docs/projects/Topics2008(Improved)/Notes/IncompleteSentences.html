<hr>
<p>An incomplete sentence is 
a sentence that is not properly terminated with a period, exclamation
point, or question mark.</p>

<p>Examples of incomplete sentences are chapter
titles, list items, and table of contents. One reason that these items should be ignored is because they
falsely lower the average sentence length (ASL). For example, chapter titles are usually just a couple of words. If you treat
every section and chapter title as a regular sentence, then these short "sentences" will dramatically
lower the ASL. In turn, this will falsely lower most of your test scores. The other reason to ignore these items is
because they are not usually part of the main content, but rather dividers or sectional markers. These items are read,
but it is the narrative content that readers may struggle with. Therefore, it is the content that should be our main focus,
and titles and list items should just be considered "noise".</p>

<p>Beginning with <i>Readability Studio</i> 1.1, incomplete sentences, by default, are ignored for all newly created projects. That is,
any word inside an incomplete sentence
is not factored into any of the statistics or tests.
Incomplete sentences are not factored into the overall
sentence and paragraph counts, which in turn will also affect some
readability scores.</p>

<p>For compatibility, projects saved from versions before 1.1 will retain the original behavior of
including incomplete sentences in the analysis. To toggle this behavior for an existing project,
select <i>Project Properties...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to display the <i>Project Properties</i> dialog. Next,
click the <i>Document Analysis</i> icon. Here you can select either
<i>Exclude from analysis</i> or <i>Include in
analysis and treat as full sentences</i> options, as illustrated
below.</p>

<p>Note that these options are also available on the <a href="../Overviews/OptionsAndSettingsOverview.html"><i>Options</i></a> dialog
(from the <i>Tools</i> menu) to change this
behavior for all future projects.</p>

<p>Although ignoring these items is recommended, there is one exception: <a href="FragmentedText.html">non-narrative</a> (i.e.,
structured) forms. Files such as r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and
application forms often contain many terse and incomplete
sentences. In these situations, you should include incomplete sentences and use
tests that do not emphasize sentence length, such as <a href="../Tests/FORCAST.html">FORCAST</a>. When creating a <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">new project</a>,
there are two ways to implicitly set these options. The first way is to select "non-narrative, fragmented text"
when specifying the <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html#docstructure">document structure</a>.
The other way is to select "non-narrative form" when specifying the <a href="../Overviews/StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html#doctype">document type</a>. By
selecting either of these options, the program will use the appropriate options and tests for these types of files.</p>
