Nouns in the Difficult Word Lists</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>When reviewing your difficult word lists, you may notice that some proper
nouns are displayed with additional information. This is to help
discern how many times
the given word is considered unfamiliar in the document (for certain
tests).</p>

<p>Certain tests, such as <a href="../Tests/DaleChall.html"><i>New Dale-Chall</i></a> and <a href="../Tests/Spache.html"><i>Revised
Spache</i></a>, treat all proper
nouns as familiar, even if they do not appear on the
test's familiar-word list. However, if the same word occurs in
the document as a non-proper noun, then that instance will be
considered unfamiliar if it is not on the test's
familiar-word list.</p>

<p>Consider the following example:</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;The Daily Examiner reported today that a tax examiner is reviewing the company's
records. The examiner will have his full report by the end of the week.&rdquo;</blockquote>

<p>The list of unfamiliar <i>DC</i> words will report the following:</p>

<blockquote>Examiner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3 (1 proper and familiar, 2 non-proper and unfamiliar)</blockquote>

<p>This means that "Examiner" in the phrase "Daily Examiner" is
proper and <i>New Dale-Chall</i> treated it as familiar. Although the
word "examiner" is not a familiar <i>DC</i>
word, a reader will recognize that
it is proper. From there, he/she can deduct that it is the name of a
specific person, place, or thing (e.g., a newspaper). Therefore, it is somewhat familiar
to the reader, even if he/she does not know the word.</p>

<p>However, the other two instances of "examiner" are regular nouns.
Because "examiner" is not on the <i>DC</i>
familiar-word list, these two instances are considered unfamiliar. When <i>DC</i>
is computed, a frequency count of 2 (not 3) will be used
for this particular word when tallying the number of unfamiliar words.</p>

<p>If a word appears only in proper form throughout the document,
then it will not appear on either the unfamiliar <i>DC</i> or
<i>Spache</i> lists. A proper noun will never appear on either of these
lists unless there are conflicting non-proper instances of the same
word.</p>

<p>Note that this also applies to any <a href="../Overviews/CreatingACustomFamiliarWordTest.html">custom
tests</a> that treat proper nouns as familiar.</p>
