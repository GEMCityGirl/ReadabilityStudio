</ul>

<p>Statistics for any custom familiar-word tests will also be included in this window
if your <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsProjectSettings.html#statsdisplay">statistics
level of detail</a> is set to <i>medium</i> or <i>verbose</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>"Notes"</i>
section may be included at the bottom of this window if there are any
items of interest detected (e.g., a high sentence-length
average). If your document requires improvement, then this section is
usually a good place to begin.</p>

<p>Note that 3+ syllable words and <i>Fog</i>
and <i>SMOG</i> hard words are
all the same except for how numerals (i.e., phone numbers and dates)
are handled. <i>SMOG</i> always sounds out each digit of a numeric word, whereas <i>Fog</i>
entirely ignores numeric words. You have control over how numeric words are
handled from the <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysis.html"><i>Document Analysis</i></a>
area of the <i>Options</i> dialog (available from the <i>Tools</i>
menu).</p>

<p>This window can be <a href="../Printing.html">printed</a> or <a href="../Exporting.html">exported</a>.</p>
