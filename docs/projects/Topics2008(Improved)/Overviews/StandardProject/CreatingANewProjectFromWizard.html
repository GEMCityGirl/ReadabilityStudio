<hr>
<p>To determine a document's readability you will need to create a new
project. First, select <i>New Project...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to open the <i>New Project</i>
wizard. The first dialog of the wizard specifies where your text will
be coming from, either from a file or by typing it into a field.</p>

<p>For example, to analyze text from an email, copy
the text from your email program, select the <i>Manually enter text</i>
option, and click the <i>Next</i>
button. You would then see the dialog below where you can paste the
email into the field.</p>

<p>To analyze a file, select the <i>Read text from a file</i>
option and click the <i>Next</i>
button to display the dialog below:</p>
	
<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardfilepath.png"></p>

<p>In this dialog you can specify which file to analyze by clicking the
button next to the file path field and browsing for it. After you
have selected your file, click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the <i>Select Document Structure</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<a name="docstructure"><p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizarddocstructure.png"></p></a>

<p>In this dialog, you will specify the format that best describes your document. You can select either
narrative text, <a href="../../Notes/LineChaining.html">(partially fragmented) narrative text</a>, or <a href="../../Notes/FragmentedText.html">non-narrative/fragmented text</a>.</p>

<p>Previews of these document types are shown next to each option. To view the full-size image of any
preview, click on it with your mouse.</p>

<p>After selecting your document structure, click the <i>Next</i> button to
continue to the <i>Readability Tests</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardreadabilitymethods.png"></p>

<p>In this dialog, you will select how you want <i>Readability Studio</i>
to choose the readability tests to perform. Your first option is to
tell <i>Readability Studio</i>
which type of document you are analyzing and it will select the most
appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the <i>Recommend tests based on
document type</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>Select
Document Type</i> dialog, where you can select which type of
document best describes your file (e.g., a literary work or
technical form), as shown below:</p>
	
<a name="doctype"><p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizarddoctype.png"></p></a>

<p>Your second option is to tell <i>Readability
Studio</i> which type of industry your document relates to and
it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this,
select the <i>Recommend
tests based on industry or field</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You
will then be presented with the <i>Select
Industry</i> dialog, where you can select which field best
describes what your file relates to (e.g., magazine publishing or the
military), as shown below:</p>


<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardindustry.png"></p>

<p>Your final option is to manually select the tests yourself. To do this,
select the <i>Manually
select tests</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>
Select Readability Tests</i> dialog, where
you can select any of the tests that <i>Readability
Studio</i> has to offer, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardtests.png"></p>

<p>Note that you can always add additional tests to your project at any
time. If you select either the document type or industry options,
you are not bound to just the tests that <i>Readability Studio</i> recommends.</p>

<p>After you have selected the tests to perform, you will then be
presented with the following dialog:</p>
		
<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardtextselections.png"></p>

<p>Here you will be able to select which <a href="ReviewingHighlightedText.html">highlighted text windows</a>
will be shown in the project. In these windows, you will be able to
view the document with various items highlighted, such as different
types of difficult words and difficult sentences.</p>
	
<p>After selecting which highlighted text windows to include you will be
presented with the following dialog:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardlistsslections.png"></p>

<p>Here you will be able to select which <a href="ReviewingDifficultWords.html">difficult word lists</a>
to include in the project. In these windows, you will be able to
review lists of difficult words (e.g., overly long words).</p>

<p>Finally, click the <i>Finish</i>
button and the project will
be created and will appear like this:</p>
	
<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/scores.png"></p>

<p>From here you can review the <a href="ReviewingScores.html">readability
scores</a> and <a href="ReviewingGraphs.html">graphs</a>,
useful document <a href="ReviewingStatistics.html">statistics</a>, and various lists of <a href="ReviewingDifficultWords.html">difficult words</a>. You can also review the document with its <a href="ReviewingHighlightedText.html">difficult words and
sentences highlighted</a>.</p>
