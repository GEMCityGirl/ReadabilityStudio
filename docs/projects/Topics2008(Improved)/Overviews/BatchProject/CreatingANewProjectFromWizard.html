<hr>

<p>To determine the readability of a document collection, you will need to create a new batch
project. First, select <i>New Project...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to open the <i>Select Project Type</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../Images/selectprojecttype.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Click the <i>Next</i> button to proceed to the <i>Select Files</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../Images/wizardbatchselectfiles.png" alt=""></p>

<p>On this dialog, you can add files from a folder or website to the project.</p>

<p>To add files from a folder, click the <i>Add folder(s)</i> button. You will be presented with
the <a href="../../Dialogs/SelectDirectory.html"><i>Select Directory</i></a> dialog:</p>

<p><img src="../../../Images/selectdirectory.png" alt=""></p>

<p>To search for files from a website and include them in the project, click the <i>Add web page(s)</i> button.
This will display the <i><a href="../../Dialogs/WebHarvester.html">Web Harvester</a></i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img src="../../../Images/webharvester.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You can also individually select files to include in the project. Click the <i>Add file(s)</i>
button and then select the file(s) that you want to include.</p>

<p><img src="../../../Images/browseforfile.png" alt=""></p>

<p>After you have selected your files, you can randomly sample a subset of these documents
for your project. Normally, you will want to analyze all the documents that you
have selected and ignore this feature. However, some research projects may require
random sampling. For these situations, check the <i>Randomly sample</i> option and enter the percentage of
documents to analyze.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/randomsample.png"></p>

<p>Note that when the project is first analyzed, the documents that were
not included in the sample will be removed from the project.</p>

<p>Click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the <i>Select Document Structure</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizarddocstructure.png"></p>

<p>In this dialog, you will specify the format that best describes your document. You can select either
narrative text, <a href="../../Notes/LineChaining.html">(partially fragmented) narrative text</a>, or <a href="../../Notes/FragmentedText.html">non-narrative/fragmented text</a>.</p>

<p>Previews of these document types are shown next to each option. To view the full-size image of any
preview, click on it with your mouse.</p>

<p>After selecting your document structure, click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the <i>Readability Tests</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardbatchreadabilitymethods.png"></p>

<p>In this dialog, you will select how you want <i>Readability Studio</i>
to choose the readability tests to perform. Your first option is to
tell <i>Readability Studio</i>
which type of document you are analyzing and it will select the most
appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the <i>Recommend tests based on
document type</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>Select
Document Type</i> dialog, where you can select which type of
document best describes your file (e.g., a literary work or
technical form), as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardbatchdoctype.png"></p>

<p>Your second option is to tell <i>Readability
Studio</i> which type of industry your document relates to and
it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this,
select the <i>Recommend tests based on industry or field</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You
will then be presented with the <i>Select
Industry</i> dialog, where you can select which field best
describes what your file relates to (e.g., magazine publishing or the
military), as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardbatchindustry.png"></p>

<p>Your final option is to manually select the tests yourself. To do this,
select the <i>Manually
select tests</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>
Select Readability Tests</i> dialog, where
you can select any of the tests that <i>Readability
Studio</i> has to offer, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardbatchtests.png"></p>

<p>Note that you can always add additional tests to your project at any
time. If you select either the document type or industry options,
you are not bound to just the tests that <i>Readability Studio</i> recommends.</p>

<p>After you have selected the tests to perform, click the <i>Finish</i>
button and the project will be created and will appear like this:</p>
