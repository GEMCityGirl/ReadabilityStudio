  <li><a href="../Tests/EFLAW.html">McAlpine EFLAW&copy;</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, <i>Readability Studio</i> offers in-depth
explanations for these tests. Each test result includes an interpretation of the score and the factors that
affect it.</p>

<p>The program also provides many useful features to help review the difficult aspects of your document.
This includes lists of various difficult words and views
of the document with difficult words and sentences highlighted. These tools
can assist you in improving your documents so that they meet their target audiences.</p>

<p>Another important feature is that the program
analyzes the entire content of your document (rather than
subsamples). This will give you the most accurate results possible.</p>

<h3><u>Helpful assistance for test selection</u></h3>

<p><i>Readability Studio</i> presents an intuitive interface for selecting
readability tests. Experts can manually select the tests that they want
to perform, while those less familiar with
these tests can be guided through a helpful <a href="StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">wizard</a>. This wizard
recommends which tests to include based on the document's type (e.g.,
text book) or industry (e.g., health care).</p>

<h3><u>Numerous file formats supported</u></h3>

<p><i>Readability Studio</i> supports importing text from many file formats,
including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ANSI and Unicode text (*.txt)</li>
  <li>Microsoft&reg; Word 95-2003 documents (*.doc)</li>
  <li>Microsoft&reg; Word 2007 documents (*.docx)</li>
  <li>OpenOffice documents (*.odt)</li>
  <li>HTML (*.htm)</li>
  <li>Rich text (*.rtf)</li>
  <li>Postscript (*.ps)</li>
  <li>Email files (*.eml)</li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need the native application for these file formats. <i>Readability Studio</i> is capable of
importing these files without any additional programs.</p>

<h3><u>Advanced exporting capabilities</u></h3>

<p><i>Readability Studio</i> provides printing and <a href="Exporting.html">exporting</a> capabilities
for all test scores, word lists, statistics, graphs, etc. This enables you to easily share and publish your results.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Test results, statistics, and difficult word lists can all
be exported as HTML or text.</li>
  <li>Highlighted document views can be exported as RTF, HTML, or
text.</li>
  <li>Graphs can be exported as TIFF, JPG, BMP, PNG, or PCX.</li>
</ul>

<h3><u>Flexibility</u></h3>
<p>Finally, <i>Readability
Studio</i> is highly configurable. Many options, such as how
documents are analyzed and how the results are displayed, are customizable. For example, you can
specify how numeric words (e.g., "10/26/1974") are syllabized. Other programs either
sound out each digit or treat the entire
word as one syllable and you cannot change this. With <i>Readability
Studio</i>, you can toggle this behavior at anytime.</p>
