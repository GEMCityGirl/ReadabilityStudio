<hr>
<p>Most software that counts syllables
employs one of two methods. The first is a dictionary-based
system that includes a list of common words and their
respective syllable count. As the software counts the syllables of a
document, each word is looked up in a dictionary to retrieve its respective
syllable count. The disadvantage of this method is that if a word is
not found, then the program must prompt the user to enter the syllable count.</p>

<p>The second syllable counting method is to use an algorithm, which is what <i>Readability Studio</i> does.
The advantage of this is that it will work with any word, without user
interaction. The disadvantage is that these algorithms are traditionally less accurate
than a dictionary approach. This is because most software uses a
formula that counts the number of vowel blocks in a word to determine
the syllable count.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this approach will not take into account
special cases where vowel blocks split into two syllables. For example, the "ui" in "fruit" is
one syllable, but in "intuitive" it splits into two syllables. Another issue is special consonant blocks. For
example, in the name "McCoy", the prefix is actually a separate syllable.</p>

<p>To overcome these shortcomings, <i>Readability Studio</i> uses
a specialized algorithm which takes into account the various
nuances and quirks of the English language when
calculating syllables counts.</p>
