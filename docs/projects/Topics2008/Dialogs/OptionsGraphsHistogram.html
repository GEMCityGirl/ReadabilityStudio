<h1><font color="#315184"><b>Histograms</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>The options on this tab allow you to customize the test score histograms included
in batch projects. Note that these options are only available for
<i>Readability Studio Professional Edition</i>.</p>

<h3><u>Bar Appearance:</u></h3>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Bar color</b></font>: Click this button to select the color used for your bars.</p>
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Solid</b></font>:
Select this option to use a solid color for your bars.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Use
a 3D effect</b></font>: Select this option to add a 3D look to your bars.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Apply a color
fade across the bar, starting from the bottom</b></font>:
Select this option to apply a color fade across your bars (starting
from the bottom).</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Apply
a color
fade across the bar, starting from the top</b></font>:
Select this option to apply a color fade across your bars (starting
from the top).</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Bar
opacity</b></font>: Sets the transparency of the bar color. Sliding this bar to the far
right will set the background
to be fully opaque, whereas sliding it to the far left will set the
background to be blank.</p>

<h3><u>Bin Sorting Options:</u></h3>

<p>Bin sorting refers to how values (e.g., index and grade scores) are categorized
into separate classes. Each of these classes (or bins) are displayed on
a histogram as a bar. The options listed here control how these bins
are created and how your data is sorted into them.</p>

<h4><u>Bin Sorting</u></h4>

<font color="#315184"><b>Create
a bin for each unique value</b></font>: Select this option to
create a bin (i.e., a bar) for every unique value. If you have floating-point
grade scores and are not rounding your values, then a bin for every
unique floating-point value will be created. If you select this option,
then it is recommend to set the rounding option to <i>Round down</i>.
<p><font color="#315184"><b>Sort
by interval</b></font>: Select this option to have the program
select the best bin sizes based on the range of your data. Rather than having
a bin for each unique value, bins will be created for ranges of values.
For example, you may have a bin representing values for grades 2-4,
rather than having separate bins for 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Sort
by neat interval</b></font>: Select this option to have the program
select the best integral bin sizes based on the range of your data. This
option is the same as <i>Sort by interval</i>, except that
it will force the bin ranges and bin sizes to be integer values. This
will prevent having ranges beginning at values such as 2.4 and will
also force the bin widths into sizes such as 2 or 3 (rather than 3.2).
By selecting this option, your intervals will precisely represent grade
ranges (e.g., grades 2-4) and prevent any overlap between the grades in
your bins.</p>

<p>Note that
if you are not rounding down your values, then scores with no mantissa
(fractional part) may fall into a bin different from the same values
with fractional parts. For example, if you have a bin ranging from 1-2
and another ranging from 2-3, then the first bin represents values
&gt; 1 and &lt;= 2 and the second bin represents values
&gt; 2 and &lt;= 3. If you not rounding down your scores, then
a score of 2 will fall into the 1-2 bin, whereas a score of 2.1 will
fall into the 2-3 bin. If you select this option,
then it is recommend to set the rounding option to <i>Round down</i>.
This will ensure that values such as 2 and 2.1 fall into the same bin.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Grade
level/index value rounding</b></font>:
This option
controls how floating-point values are rounded
when being sorted into the bins. You may choose from the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Round</b>:
Select this option to round grade-level scores up or down (based on
their fractional part) when sorting them into the histogram's bins.
Values such as 4 and 4.3 will be sorted as 4, whereas 4.5 and 4.9 will
be sorted as 5.</li>

<li><b>Round down</b>: Select this option to round
grade-level
scores down when sorting them
into the histogram's bins. Values such as 4, 4.3, and
4.9 will be sorted as 4. This selection is recommended.</li>

<li><b>Round up</b>: Select this option to round grade-level
scores up when sorting them
into the histogram's bins. Values such as 4 will be
sorted as 4, whereas 4.1, 4.3, and 4.9 will be sorted as 5. This
selection is not recommended and should only be used for special cases.</li>

<li><b>Do not round</b>: Select this option to not round any
grade-level scores. Scores will be sorted into the bins exactly as they
appear with their fractional parts. This selection is not recommended
and should only be used for special cases.</li>
</ul>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Cumulative bins</b></font>:
Select this option for the bars to represent the cumulative number of observations in all of the bins up to (and including) the specified bin.</p>

<h3><u>Bin Display:</u></h3>
<p>These options control the display of the axis labels, bar labels, and side title of the histogram.</p>
<h4><u>Bin Interval</u></h4>
<p><font><b>Cutpoints</b></font>: Select this option to display the axis bin intervals on the sides of the bars.</p>

<p><font><b>Midpoints</b></font>: Select this option to display the axis bin intervals centered under the bars. For neat intervals, the label will be the range of the bin; otherwise, it will be the midpoint.</p>

<h4><u>Bin Labels</u></h4>
<p><font><b>Number of documents</b></font>: Select this option to display the number of documents as the bin label. This label will appear at the top of each bar.</p>

<p><font><b>Percentage of documents</b></font>: Select this option to display the percentage of documents as the bin label. This label will appear at the top of each bar.</p>

<p><font><b>Number and percentage of documents</b></font>: Select this option to display the number and percentage of documents as the bin label. This label will appear at the top of each bar.</p>
