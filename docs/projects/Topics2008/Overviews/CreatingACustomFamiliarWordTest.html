a Custom Familiar Word Test</b></font></h1>
<hr>
<p>Along with
offering standard familiar-word tests, such as <a href="../Tests/DaleChall.html"><i>New
Dale Chall</i></a> and <a href="../Tests/Spache.html"><i>Revised
Spache</i></a>, <i>Readability
Studio</i> also includes the ability to create your own familiar-word test. Many
customizable features are offered for new tests, such as being able to
select our own familiar-word list and which formula to use.</p>

<p>To create a custom familiar-word test, go to the <i>Readability</i>
menu and select <i>Add Test...</i> from the <i>Custom
Tests</i> submenu. At this point, the <i>Add
Custom Word Test</i> dialog will be displayed:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/AddCustomTest.png"></p>

<p>Enter a name for this test and
then enter the path to the familiar-word file. This file must be a text
file and each word must be separated by a space, tab, or new line. An
example file would look like this:</p>

<p><tt>apple orange pear</tt></p>

<p>or like this:</p>

<p><tt>apple<br>

orange<br>

pear</tt></p>

<p>After selecting the word file, click the <i>View
familiar word list</i> button to view the words imported from
the file.</p>

<p>The next step is to decide which familiar-word test formula to use. Please refer
to <a href="../Tests/DaleChall.html"><i>New
Dale Chall</i></a> (the default) and <a href="../Tests/Spache.html"><i>Revised
Spache</i></a> to help decide which test you prefer.</p>

<p>Next, you can specify which type of
stemming (if any at all) to use.&nbsp;Stemming compares words based
on their roots and is useful for finding words that appear in different forms.
This comparison is performed when words from a document are being matched
against your familiar-word list. For
example, let us say that you have the word "open" in your list and
have English stemming selected. When you analyze a document, words such
as "opened" and "opening" will be considered familiar, even if they are
not explicitly in your word list.</p>

<p>If you are not using stemming, then it is recommended that you enter each
form of your words (e.g., possessive, plural) in your familiar-word
list. For example, you would need to have "open", "opens", "opening",
etc. explicitly in your list if you want each form of "open" to be
considered familiar.<</p>

<p>Standard familiar-word tests normally
consider numbers and proper nouns as familiar. This is
the default behavior for a custom test as well, but these can be
toggled with the options shown below.</p>

<p>Along with your own word list, you can also use the
<i>Dale-Chall</i> and <i>Spache</i>
word lists in conjunction with it. This enables you to make your word list an
appendage to the <i>Dale-Chall</i>
word list, therefore creating your own
extended <i>Dale-Chall</i> test. This behavior can be toggled with the options shown below.</p>

<p>Finally, you can specify how this test interacts with the <a href="StandardProject/CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html"><i>New
Project Wizard</i></a>
by associating it with document types and industries. Click the <i>Project
Wizard Settings</i> button to display these options. Then select all of the documents and
industries that this test will relate to.</p>

<p>For example, select the <i>Children's
literature</i> and <i>Children's
healthcare</i> check boxes (as shown below) and click <i>OK</i>:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../Images/CustomTestWizardSettings.png"></p>

<p>Now create a new project and select <i>Children's healthcare</i>
as the industry that your document relates. Once the program loads the
document, your custom test will be automatically included in the
results.</p>
