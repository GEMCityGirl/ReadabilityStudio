<p><i>Readability Studio</i> offers many features to customize how documents are
parsed and analyzed, as well as how results are displayed. These
options can be configured both globally and for individual projects. It
is important to note that setting any of the global options will affect
all future created projects, but will not affect currently existing
projects. To set these options globally, select from the main menu
<i>Tools/Options...</i> to open the <i>Options</i> dialog. If you wish to change any
options for an individual project, then select from the main menu
<i>File/Project Settings...</i> to open the <i>Project Settings</i> dialog.</p>
