<hr>

<p>To determine the readability of a document collection, you will need to create a new batch
project. First, select <i>New Project...</i> from the <i>File</i>
menu to open the <i>Select Project Type</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p>Click the <i>Next</i> button to proceed to the <i>Select Files</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p>On this dialog, you can add files from a folder or website to the project.</p>
<p>To add files from a folder, click the <i>Add folder(s)</i> button. You will be presented with
the <a href="../../Dialogs/SelectDirectory.html"><i>Select Directory</i></a> dialog:</p>

<p>To search for files from a website and include them in the project, click the <i>Add web page(s)</i> button.
This will display the <i><a href="../../Dialogs/WebHarvester.html">Web Harvester</a></i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p>You can also individually select files to include in the project. Click the <i>Add file(s)</i>
button and then select the file(s) that you want to include.</p>

<p>After you have selected your files, you can randomly sample a subset of these document
to be included in the project. Normally you will want to analyze all of the documents that you
have selected and leave this option unchecked. However, some research projects may require
random subsampling. For these situations, check the <i>Randomly sample</i> option and enter the percentage of
the documents to analyze. Note that once the project is first analyzed, the documents that were
not included in the sample will be removed from the project.</p>

<p>Click the <i>Next</i> button to continue to the <i>Readability Tests</i> dialog, as shown below:</p>

<p>In this dialog, you will select how you want <i>Readability Studio</i>
to choose the readability tests to perform. Your first option is to
tell <i>Readability Studio</i>
which type of document you are analyzing and it will select the most
appropriate tests based on that. To do this, select the <i>Recommend tests based on
document type</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>Select
Document Type</i> dialog, where you can select which type of
document best describes your file (e.g., a literary work or
technical form), as shown below:</p>
	
<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizarddoctype.png"></p>

<p>Your second option is to tell <i>Readability
Studio</i> which type of industry your document relates to and
it will select the most appropriate tests based on that. To do this,
select the <i>Recommend tests based on industry or field</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You
will then be presented with the <i>Select
Industry</i> dialog, where you can select which field best
describes what your file relates to (e.g., magazine publishing or the
military), as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardindustry.png"></p>

<p>Your final option is to manually select the tests yourself. To do this,
select the <i>Manually
select tests</i> option and click the <i>Next</i> button. You will then be presented with the <i>
Select Readability Tests</i> dialog, where
you can select any of the tests that <i>Readability
Studio</i> has to offer, as shown below:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wizardtests.png"></p>

<p>Note that you can always add additional tests to your project at any
time. If you select either the document type or industry options,
you are not bound to just the tests that <i>Readability Studio</i> recommends.</p>

<p>After you have selected the tests to perform, click the <i>Finish</i>
button and the project will be created and will appear like this:</p>
