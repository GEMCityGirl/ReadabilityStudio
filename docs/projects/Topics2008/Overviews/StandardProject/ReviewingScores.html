<hr>
<p>After opening a project, click on the <i>Readability Scores</i>
icon on the project sidebar to view all of the test scores, as well as
their respective explanations and recommendations.</p>

<p>The top area of the <i>Readability Scores</i> window is the score
grid. In here there are four columns:</p>

<ul>
  <li><i>Test</i>:
the name of the readability test</li>

  <li><i>U.S.
Grade Level</i>: the grade level that the test determined the
document is suitable for</li>

  <li><i>Reader
Age</i>: the reader's age that the test determined the document
is suitable for<</li>

  <li><i>Scale
Value</i>: the score value for tests that use special scales</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that
most tests have just one&nbsp;type of result (e.g., grade level),
so non-applicable columns are left blank. For example, note below that
the <a href="../../Tests/GunningFog.html"><i>Gunning Fog</i></a>
result is a U.S. grade level of 9.1. This translates to a
ninth grade level reader (in his or her first month of class). Because
this test returns a U.S. grade level and age and does not use
any a scale, the <i>Scale Value</i> column is empty.
Another example is the result for the <a href="../../Tests/Flesch.html"><i>Flesch
Reading Ease</i></a>
test, which is a scale value 0f 80. This test has its own scale,
instead of a grade level, so its age and grade level columns are empty.</p>

<p>Select any
test in the results grid to display an explanation of its score in the
window below.</p>

<p>Along with
an explanation of the test's results, tips are also provided for how to
lower the score, as well as a brief summary of what type of text this
test is appropriate for.</p>

<p>Finally, the averages of your test
scores and ages are displayed at the bottom of the results window. Their
respective medians and standard deviations are also
included if your <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysisProjectSettings.html#statsdisplay">statistics
display</a> is set to <i>verbose</i>.</p>

<p>This window can be printed or exported if you want to further review them
outside of <i>Readability
Studio</i>. To print, go to the <i>File</i> menu
and the <i>Print...</i> option. To save, go to the <i>File</i>
menu and the <i>Export test scores...</i> option. You can
also find these options on the toolbar or by right clicking on this
window.</p>
