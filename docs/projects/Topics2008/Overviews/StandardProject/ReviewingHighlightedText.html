<hr>
<p>After opening a project, click on the <i>View Document</i> icon
on the project sidebar to view the text windows that have difficult
words (or sentences) highlighted.</p>

<p>The different types of text windows that may be shown (depending on
which ones were selected from the <a href="CreatingANewProjectFromWizard.html">Project Wizard</a>) are:</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Plain text</b></font>:
This text window is the document with nothing highlighted.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>3+ syllable
words</b></font>: This text window contains the document
with all of the words that are three or more syllables highlighted.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>6+ character
words</b></font>: This text window contains the document
with all of the words that are six or more characters long highlighted.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>DC unfamiliar
words</b></font>: This text window contains the document
with all of the <i>Dale-Chall</i>
unfamiliar words highlighted. The <i>Dale-Chall</i>
word list is a collection of words that are considered to be familiar
to most fourth grade readers. Words in the document that are not found
on this list may be less familiar to younger readers and hence more
difficult.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Spache
unfamiliar words</b></font>: This text window contains the
document with all of the <i>Spache</i>
unfamiliar words highlighted. The <i>Spache</i>
word list is a collection of words that are considered to be familiar
to most fourth grade readers. Words in the document that are not found
on this list may be less familiar to younger readers and hence more
difficult.</p>

<p><font color="#315184"><b>Long sentences</b></font>:
This text window contains the document with all of the overly long
sentences highlighted.</p>

<p>To view any
of these text windows, simply click on the tab strip:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/wordstab.png"></p>

<p>In the case
of the <i>long sentences </i>text window, all overly long
sentences will be highlighted.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../../Images/textwindow.png"></p>

<p>You can add
or remove any of these windows, as well as change both the font and
highlighting color, by opening the <i>Project Settings</i>
dialog and clicking the <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentDisplayGeneral.html"><i>Document Display</i></a>
icon. Note that changing these options from the <i>Project
Settings</i> dialog will only affect the current project. If you
want to make changes to any future projects that you will be making,
then go to the <i>Options</i> dialog from the <i>Tools</i>
menu instead.</p>

<p>As a
special note for documents with numerous sentences over twenty words
long, it is recommenced to open the <i>Project Settings</i>
dialog and click the <a href="../../Dialogs/OptionsDocumentAnalysisSentencesWords.html"><i>Document Analysis</i></a>
icon and select the option <i>Outside of sentence outlier range</i>.
This will make is so that only the extremely long sentences (in
comparison to the other sentences in the document) are highlighted.
This will make it easier to pinpoint the most troublesome sentences
that need to be shortened.</p>

<p>Any of
these windows can be printed or exported if you want to further review
them outside of <i>Readability Studio</i>. To print a text
window, go to the <i>File</i> menu and select the <i>Print...</i>
option. To save a text window, go to the <i>File</i> menu
and select the <i>Export highlighted document...</i>
option. You can also find these options on the toolbar or by right clicking on a text
window.</p>
