<hr>
<p>In this
example, we will save a customized list of the more complex words from
a book. If you are an educator, you can send this list to your students
and ask them to define these words prior to reading the book. This can
be a great way to prepare them for future readings, as well as helping
them build their overall vocabulary.</p>

<p>Continuing
from <a href="BookExample.html">example 1</a>,
select the top item in the hard word list. Now scroll down to the last word
that has six syllables, hold down the <b>SHIFT</b> key, and select this word. Now you will have all of the words with six
or more syllables selected. If there are any words that you want to add
or remove from your selection, hold down the <b>CTRL</b>
key and click on them. Your word list will look like this:</p>

<p>Now that
you have selected the words that you want to save, click the <i>Export</i>
button on the toolbar:</p>

<p>A <i>Save As</i> dialog will appear and you will have the option to save as
either HTML or text. Select where you want to save the
file and click <i>Save</i>.</p>

<p>Next, the <i>Export Options</i>
dialog will appear. Note that by default, all of the words will be
exported. To export just the words that you have highlighted, select
the checkbox <i>Only export selected rows</i>. Also,
because we are only interested in saving the <i>Word</i>
column, not the <i>Syllable Count</i> or <i>Frequency</i>
columns, enter 1 in the <i>Columns: to</i> and <i>Columns: from </i>fields. Finally, uncheck
the option <i>Include column headers</i> because we are
only exporting on column. Your <i>Export Options</i> will
look like this:</p>

<p>Click <i>OK</i>
to export the word list and then you can distribute
this file to your students to help prepare them for their reading
assignments.</p>
