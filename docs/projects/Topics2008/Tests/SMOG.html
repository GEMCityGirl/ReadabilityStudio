<hr>
<p>The <i><b>SMOG</b></i>
readability formula calculates the U.S. grade level of a text sample
based on sentence length and number of complex words (i.e., words that contain three or more syllables).</p>
	
<p>The <i><b>McLaughlin SMOG</b></i> is
generally appropriate for secondary age (4th grade to college level)
readers. <i><b>SMOG</b></i>
tests for 100% comprehension, whereas most formulas test
for around 50%-75% comprehension.</p>

<p>Note that numerals are fully syllabized (i.e., sounded
out) for this test, so <i>Readability
Studio</i> always overrides your numeral syllabication setting
when calculating it.</p>
		
<h3><u>The SMOG Formula</u></h3>
		
<blockquote>L = ROUND(&radic;W) + 3</blockquote>

<p>Where:</p>
		
<blockquote>
<table style="text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>L</td>
<td>U.S. grade level</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>W</td>
<td>Number of complex words (3+ syllables)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</blockquote>

<p>This test requires a 30-sentence sample; however, note that <i>Readability
Studio</i> always analyzes your entire document to
guarantee the most accurate results and does not
use subsamples for any of its test calculations. If a
formula requires a subsample of a specific size, then
standardization is used.</p>

<p>Note that this test is often referred to as an acronym for Simple
Measure of Gobbledygook, although the origin of its name is actually a
nod to Robert Gunning's Fog index.</p>
